      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

term='Notions'/><title type='text'>Jordan, Shut Up and Jam</title><content type='html'>As some of you might know, for a while Frank has been developing (with help from Fitzy) the idea of a rock opera based around Space Jam, which I'm pretty sure everyone who reads this has seen. But if you haven't it's basically a film where Michael Jordan teams up with the Looney Tunes and then makes his comeback to the NBA. I watched the film last night, and before I get into the body of the post I have a few observations to make:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;a) Marvin Martian is a really shitty referee, I mean he just flat out lets extreme physical aggression slide, I mean I've just finished re-watching it with Larney, and literally anything goes, which goes well for the whole physical comedy and The Monsters are Dicks part of the film, but I mean it's just flat out shitty refereeing. I'm also pretty sure the Looney Tunes have more than 5 players on the court at one point.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;b) Shawn Bradley and Muggsy Bogues should have done a buddy comedy, but the golden opportunity has been missed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;c) This film seems completely okay with having Michael gambling and wagering up in.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;d) Larry Bird and Bill Murray also should have done a buddy comedy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;e)  This film would be better off it used some pre-established Looney Tunes characters as the villains, rather than Danny DeVito and those annoying small dudes, like say Marvin Martian and some bros of his. They have the added bonus of having those bad-ass hats, and being well-known, so it becomes more iconic.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;f) One more thing, at the start of the film Jordan's son gets out of the car, and seems depressed. Jordan asks "you ok?" and the son shakes his head. THIS IS NEVER MENTIONED AGAIN. This could have made for some grimdark subplot about fatherhood or depression in children, but hey what everyone really wants is the Monstars.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But to the rock opera, so I watched through the film, and realised that Space Jam has great potential for a truly brilliant musical. It has room for some great themes, like ambition, the greater good, the nature of talent, and gambling addiction. So basically in this post I'm just write up the really preliminary tracklist and for a couple of tracks a short plot note. I'm going to be watching through most of the Looney Tunes shorts up to the 60s over the next few months, so some things will probably be changing as I learn more.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ladies &amp;amp; Gentlemen, Michael Jordan&lt;/i&gt;: This track (which plays as if being performed by a busker, relating a legend or forgotten folk tale) introduces the character of Michael Jordan, World's Greatest Basketball Player. Starting from his sophomore year of high school, where is rejected for the varsity team due to being 5'11", this song tracks his meteoric rise to global icon, and ends with the death of his father and his retirement from basketball to pursue a career in baseball.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;We Need Something Looney&lt;/i&gt;: This track introduces the villains of the piece (right now the Martians, which will mean some War of the Worlds references being thrown in, but for this post they'll resemble the Nerdlucks more than the Martians). The Mars theme park, which represents the backbone of their economy, and main source of employment, is struggling. The boss, Marvin, decides what they need is new attractions, and while thinking out loud, accidentally sits on TV remote, and his underlings see, on several screens, some old Merrie Melodies cartoons. This song then describes their reaction to seeing the classic cartoons, and after Marvin witnesses it, he agrees that they need something &lt;b&gt;looney&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;How to Capture a Cartoon Character&lt;/i&gt;: The Martians arrive in Looney Tune Land, and declare that the Looney Tunes are their prisoners. At first the Looney Tunes find this hilarious, but when the Martians brandish their high-tech weapons, only Bugs Bunny's quick thinking allows them a chance to defend themselves. After talking about the Martians, the Looney Tunes decide that basketball is the perfect way out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Can't Teach That (Don't Swing)&lt;/i&gt;: The story shifts back to Michael Jordan, now at the Double-A Birmingham Barons. Even though his batting average is just above the Mendoza Line, everyone still treats him like a star, which makes him uneasy. After striking out for the 3rd time in a game against the Hunstville Stars, Michael has a solo, where he debates the reasons he retired and entered baseball with himself, and wonders if he has truly made the right decision. He considers returning to the NBA, but opts against it, reasoning that quitting because it got too tough is not becoming of the Greatest of All Time, and would set a bad example for his oldest son, who is making a name for himself in local Little League.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Best Players in the World&lt;/i&gt;: While trying to improve their wack game, the Martians discover the NBA through an instructional film. They set off to find the "Best Players in the World" to even the playing field. They, one at a time, briefly describe the things they will do with the talent they plan to steal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;You Heard of the Dream Team?&lt;/i&gt;: The Martians successfully steal the talent of Muggsy Bogues, Larry Johnson, Patrick Ewing, Charles Barkley, and Shawn Bradley. They don't realise they have 2 centers and no shooting guard. They show off their talent after the Looney Tunes mock their height. The Looney Tunes panic, and decide they desperately need help to avoid slavery. Michael hears about what has happened to the players on the news, and decides that he was right to retire.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I'm a Baseball Player Now&lt;/i&gt;: The Looney Tunes decide they need to pull out the big guns. After being turned down by LeBron James in an hour long press conference, they decide they need one of the retired greats. They kidnap Michael Jordan on a golf course, and tell him what they face if he does not help them. He laments that although he would love nothing more than to shoot hoops again, he has left that life behind. But after being confronted and mocked by the transformed Martians, he decides to play.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fly Like an Eagle&lt;/i&gt;: Michael kits up, and at first is worried that his game will have deteriorated in his time away. However, once he picks up the ball and starts playing, it is clear that is not the case. He sings of the pure unadulterated joy he feels when he jumps toward a hoop, ball in hand, and contrasts it to his struggles in baseball. He curses himself for squandering such a gift during some of the prime years of his life, and decides that once he returns to the real world he will re-sign with the Bulls.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;You're Not Charles Barkley&lt;/i&gt;: Michael's rediscovery of his talent is contrasted with the fates of the players who have had their talent stolen. It opens with Charles Barkley being called a wannabe by a group of young girls after they outplay him. This song describes the treatment of the 5 players both in hospital and in the world at large. They ruminate on how they are no longer seen as themselves, but as imitators of who they once were. They begin to adjust to life, but feel frustrated in their new jobs when customers "mistake" them for famous basketball players. They all feel they should have retired in their prime, before they became shadows of the greats they once were.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;You'll Always Lose&lt;/i&gt;: (Duet) Having heard word that the Looney Tunes have a secret weapon, Marvin waits outside their training facility to confront Michael. After seeing for himself that the rumours are true, Marvin decides he must be stopped, for if they do not have the Looney Tunes, their theme park, and by extension, the entire Martian economy, will fail. Michael meets Marvin after staying late, and Marvin tries to provoke him, calling him washed-up, and referring to him as The Baseball Player, but Michael is unfazed. Marvin then describes what he has planned for the Looney Tunes, and asks Michael why is he going back on his own word to help them, and hints that Michael is really just looking for an excuse to quit on baseball, and go back to basketball, a safe environment. He tells Michael that he is bound to lose, because his team has stolen the talent of the NBA players. Michael replies that he will always look out for his friends, and offers to raise the wager. If the Looney Tunes win, Marvin will return the NBA talent, but if they lose, Marvin will have Michael as his new attraction. He tells Michael that he will have him play one-on-one all day, and that it will be rigged so he'll always lose. Although secretly this horrifies Michael, he presses ahead and finalises the new wager.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;No More Basketball&lt;/i&gt;: After players all across the country refuse to play because of what happened to the 5, David Stern announces the current basketball season is cancelled. Watching it on the news, the 5 curse themselves for destroying professional basketball.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Let's Have Some Fun&lt;/i&gt;: Michael has not told the Looney Tunes about the talent-stealing, since he knows it will demoralise them. He sings about they have formed a bond, and he could not live with himself if he lets them down. He gives them a pep talk, and assures them this is a game they can win. He tells them to just go out and have fun, which he says is something he never did in his last few years in the NBA.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ultimate Game (Part I of II)&lt;/i&gt;: This song describes the first half of the "Ultimate" game between the Martians and the Looney Tunes. At first they are resoudingly beaten, and the ref (on Martian payroll) routinely ignores blatant fouls. Even Michael struggles, as he is routinely triple-teamed by the Martians, who seem too fast and skilled to stop. Despondent, and trailing 66-18, the Looney Tunes head for the locker room at half-time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Know We're Down (We Can Still Win)&lt;/i&gt;: In the locker room, Michael tries and fails to rouse the Looney Tunes, and accidentally lets slip that the Martians stole NBA talent. Angered that Michael did not tell them this important bit of information, and feeling that they have no hope of coming back from a 48-point deficit against 5 all-stars, they suggest they forfeit. Michael snaps, and sings at the top of his voice that he was not dragged here just to have them quit on him, and tells them that he has put his own life on the line to return their freedom and the talent of his friends. He explains that someone should never quit, even if the odds seem insurmountable. After a pause, he tells them the problem has been they've been playing average basketball, which the Martians are doing better. To win, he says, they'll need to play more "Looney" basketball.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Ultimate Game (Part II of II)&lt;/i&gt;: The Looney Tunes play "looney" basketball, and it seems to be working.  They frustrate the Martians at every turn, and narrow the score to 109-108 when, with 23 seconds to go, Marvin calls a timeout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;No Sweat (This is Looney Tune Land)&lt;/i&gt;: Michael is anxious, and worries that putting himself on the line may have been a futile, pointless gesture. Marvin comes over and offers him one last chance to pull out, all he has to do is forfeit the game. Although the Looney Tunes tell him it is the right thing to do, he refuses, and reiterates that he does not quit on his friends. Michael then discusses a strategy with Bugs and Daffy, but they explain how, in Looney Tune Land, anything is possible. Outraged, Marvin returns to his team, and tells them to "crush 'em". &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fly Like an Eagle (Part II)&lt;/i&gt;: The first play after resuming goes badly for the Looney Tunes, and 2 of their players are injured. However, thanks to a lucky touch, Michael gets the ball, and decides to take it to the hole. However, with 7 seconds left he is only at half-court, and deciding that he has nothing to lose, goes to dunk. Accompanied by soaring strings, the song describes how Michael jumps from half-court, and when the Martians try to drag him down, he stretches his hand to an incredible length to dunk the ball just before the buzzer. The Looney Tunes have won, and there is much rejoicing. The Martians then return the talent.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;I Caught It (Raw Talent)&lt;/i&gt;: Michael returns to the real world, and finds the 5 all-stars in a gym, trying and failing to shoot from the field. They notice Michael, and he jokes about their horrible game. They tell him how hard it has been for them without talent, and he offers to return it to them. After some hesitation, they agree to touch the talent-ball, and when he throws the now empty ball to Muggsy, he catches it, and joyously dribbles. The players then challenge Michael to a 3-on-3, and he says he's done with that. They suggest that he refuses the challenge because he's lost his touch, and he says that there's only one way to find out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;That's All Folks&lt;/i&gt;: The first part of the song describes Michael's triumphant return to the NBA, where, in a charity 3-on-3 exhibition, he goes shot for shot with the best players in the NBA. They, in chorus, tell of how the court is their home, and how they find the purest joy in playing basketball. The story ends with Michael going to the hole, and there is then a rollcall, which has a melody borrowed from the classic Merrie Melodies tune.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's about it, I mean it's a first draft, so I'll be changing a lot of stuff, but it's a good idea, and hopefully with some work and writing we can get it to where it needs to be. Also if you have any titles tell Frank, because I don't think Space Jam: The Rock Opera can be used.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Shut up and jam,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2013/03/jordan-shut-up-and-jam.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8276073783988561985'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8276073783988561985'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-3282987824637908668</id><published>2012-04-04T03:19:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2012-06-25T21:58:30.558+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Recovery</title><content type='html'>Recovery is officially out now, so I'm gonna talk about it without fear of legal repercussions (on that note, I should probably delete my short-lived mp3 blog) and Anderson asked me about it today so here's my Impressions of Recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don't give a fuck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's really hard to give a fuck about Recovery, everyone I know except Darver, Corey, and Mully has knotted over it, but I think I've listen to it maybe one and a half times since I downloaded it; Relapse got 3 times as much play at least. The marketing campaign was a lot less embarrassing this time, there wasn't any Teabagging with Bruno, just the usual routine of freestyles and talk show appearances and interviews. Em obviously realised Relapse is what nobody wanted, even though on paper an Eminem album produced entirely by Dre wasn't a bad idea, jokes about drug addiction and rape aren't gonna play in an era where Drake is taken seriously by heads. I thought it was like a 4/10, but there were 2 songs on it, Deja Vu, and Beautiful, which were mind-blowing, both flow- and rhymes-wise, and they hinted that Eminem had in him an incredible concept album about addiction and rehab and all the attendant concepts of AA. Turns out, he didn't.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Originally there was gonna be a Relapse 2, there was even a Refill EP released to stoke interest (it was pretty good, 7.5/10), the rapping was great, and it had Forever, where Eminem shows up Drake, and Kanye, and Lil Wayne, who are all somehow GOAT candidates, and a great song with Dre, Hell Breaks Loose, which rivals Old Times Sake, my 3rd favourite song on Relapse. Hell, even the comical lead single was tight, unlike We Made You, which was embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But then about Relapse 2, Em announces that he's been working with Just Blaze, who was on the way back up thanks to his work with Jay Elec, and I was getting excited again, and also Alchemist was gonna have beats on an Em album at long last. He promised PARENTAL ADVISORY: EXTREMELY HONEST CONTENT, and it actually sounded like a good idea, but then around mid-Spring, after a while in the dark, new shit came to light. It kinda went like this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;"Boi-1da's gonna produce shit for this", "Jim Jonsin will produce the lead single", "(feat. Lil Wayne)", and I realised what had happened. Although he talks about how he doesn't want MMLP levels of fame, and is just in it for the rapping, this was gonna be album with crazy commercial considerations, even though he still had enough cred that he could do 808s &amp;amp; Heartbreak numbers with an album produced by Oktopus. It was depressing to see Eminem working with the likes of Boi-1da and Jim Jonsin, when ten years ago he was working with Da Beatminerz and Thirstin Howl III.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the actual album. I knew I wouldn't feel it from the moment I heard "Not Afraid", which is some terrible motivational speaker bullshit. The whole album is a mix of that and club jams, and some terrible love songs thrown in (Eminem doesn't do these very well), and also a mid-tier H.E.R. song (25 to Life) which has a great chorus, and isn't too bad, but pales in comparison to the inspiration. Of the other songs, only Going Through Changes has any significant replay value, and the whole thing is just completely forgettable. I mean there isn't that much to be wrote about how the producers phone in their signature styles, or how the guest spots are poorly chosen, or how Eminem has lost a few steps from even a few months ago. There are 2 good things I'll say about it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;a) Eminem's finally abandoned The Template LP, there's no I Still Don't Give a Fuck, no The Real Slim Shady, no Dr. Dre guest spot, maybe when he adjusts better to making a full record away from this template, it'll improve, but I'm not mad optimistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) No skits, no Berman, no Ken Kaniff, no Paul Rosenberg. I'mokwiththis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eminem's stuff between 98-02 is some of the best rapping ever done, it had everything, he had no limits. Eminem's stuff since his comeback has been tired, forced, and unfunny, where previously even his SRS stuff had a touch of black comedy about them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was still better than Rakim's comeback,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/recovery.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3282987824637908668'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3282987824637908668'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-6067177134109449747</id><published>2012-04-04T01:52:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2012-06-25T21:58:30.560+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Fiction'/><title type='text'>a short story whoa check it out</title><content type='html'>The night, as it happens, goes far better than you expected or maybe even hoped from the part of your brain that deals in unrealistic fantasies. And the time you spend together, at that table, gives new meanings to actions and glances that have taken place over the last five months. You can’t remember being happier or ever feeling more like you belong than at that table with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At breakfast, she kisses your cheek in a way that just about drives you wild, and straight afterward you share what could be called a “holy moment”, just looking at each other. On the bus home, she falls near-asleep, and you have to hold her to stop her unwillingly falling off the seat, you feel, when the bus makes a particularly sharp or sudden turn. When you both disembark, she feels strongly enough to use the public restroom across the street. It falls upon Shauna to take her over and check for any like bad things, while you sit beside a statue of a Revolutionary you’ve never heard of. Anyway, she returns and she complains about her shoes, which you say - Yeah I can imagine - and there’s a like very comfortable silence, then you tune into the conversations of people across the road, and then that’s broken by some very friendly banter between you and her and the other 6 people there. You don’t feel tired, it’s probably worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after everyone else has finalised their plans for return home, she asks you if you’d mind bumming around town for a while are the exact words she uses. You say sure you haven’t really made any other plans for that morning and perhaps a more substantial breakfast could be gotten somewhere. Anyway so you walk off with her, arms around her, the way you’ve seen men put their arm around Their Woman in so many of the movies you’ve seen, in the direction of every place that you could conceivably get breakfast from. Conveniently, all these places go along one stretch of road, but as it turns out, as you pass each, none open ‘til half eight at the earliest, and the time on your watch currently reading seven-thirty, and thus waiting outside anywhere is really implausible, because she needs to sit down and get to not be conscious of her feet for just a second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you end up stopping outside of the press office, and you just stand there for a while. She takes off her shoes, and the appearance of her feet is serene, not in keeping with the pain she’s been describing. They aren’t visibly scarred or blistered or dry, they appear exactly like you imagine feet should. Anyway she does appear visibly discomforted, the way she keeps shifting weight from one foot to the other. She’s standing directly beside a grille, and she’s resting against the glass store-front, which is filled with recent clippings and advertisements for the paper, with the distinctive red typeface and headline fonts, which in your mind will always signify Wednesday. Her dress is purple and knee-length, and quite simply stunning. This was actually the first thing you said to her yesterday, when she arrived at your door, and you stood there, assuming a pose of calm you had rehearsed beforehand. She had, over the course of the night, asked you several times - Do I look alright - and every time you had replied with a riff on the line - You look stunning - although you aren’t sure if she believed you. She’s good people, my mother told me the first time my mother met her, - She’s good people, you can tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you keep goin’ on to the McDonalds which you’ve both agreed is likely to be serving breakfast at this time, seven-forty-five by your watch. Your arm’s been around her this whole time, and you have to walk a lot slower than you normally would, and you’re holding her shoes in your left hand. You see familiar faces, and you exchange pleasantries with them without stopping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directly before you first kiss, a friend takes you aside, expresses disappointment but also and this is the thing that sticks, says - If you want something, you just have to go for it - and the way this seems just so damn relevant to what’s going on, you don’t normally go in for the fate thing, but this is probably the thing that starts it. But the big thing, the thing that surprises you about kissing her, is the complete subsiding of your normal unbearable self-consciousness for that moment.&lt;br /&gt;But back to the morning. You’re actually really impressed with the grace she has while crossing the gravelled road in bare feet, something that you’ve never been able to do, even as a child with a lower-than-average awareness of pain, and you position yourself on a wall that has a brick lying beside it. Anyway, she starts hiccupping at this point, and this hiccupping on her account has been going on and off for a week, so it is, for her, extremely frustrating, she in fact expressed a concern that her hiccups had ruined the night, and you had to re-assure her that just wasn’t true, and as you ring your father to go home and also give her a way home, she leans against you and cries quietly, due to frustration at her inability to control this thing. This isn’t the first time she’s cried in front of you, and you secretly feel validated, as she’s told you she’s never cried in front of anyone else, in fact going out of her way to isolate herself from her family whenever she did cry, but the other time is the first time you felt connected to anyone, when you stayed up with her until three a.m., just listening to her cry, being there with her, after her uncle died.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so you both sit on the wall, your head against her shoulder, you holding her, motorists seeing you both and inventing a back story as to how you both ended up in that position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She’s wearing your jacket too, has been for some time, and you’re aware that this another cliché, but that it doesn’t bother you, and ditto that you’re cold. Anyway, you’re father takes you both to her house, and she gives you back your jacket, and you both get out and walk up to her front door, and you hold her, briefly, not knowing this is the last time you’ll ever speak to her.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2009/03/my-characters-are-all-fictional.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6067177134109449747'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6067177134109449747'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-8026965796738240383</id><published>2012-02-22T05:33:00.000Z</published><updated>2012-06-25T21:58:30.561+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Geography'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Statistical Analysis'/><title type='text'>water footprint</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Abstract&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Background: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;As global population continues to increase and developing countries develop, increased importance is placed on the division of water for various important uses. By comparing the water footprint and net virtual water import/export of a developed country with an arid climate with that of a developing nation with a similar climate, it is hoped insight can be gained into water resource management, what a water footprint reveals about a nation’s situation, and how increasing globalization impacts upon developing nations and their water usage and supply. The history, development, methods, and implications of the Virtual Water and Water Footprint concepts are also explored and discussed, so as to give a background for the analysis and comparison.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Result: &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Spain and Morocco are found to have much in common in terms of climate, but it is found that, through examination of available data, that they differ in key areas, which indicate differences in economic standing. Attention is focused primarily on agricultural water use, due to a lack of available detailed information about the Moroccan industrial sector, and also because there are interesting contrasts in Spanish and Moroccan agricultural sectors, particularly in currency value/water usage ratios, and through-trade.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt; Although they are at different stages of economic development, Spain and Morocco face similar problems with regards to water scarcity. An analysis of their agricultural sectors reveals that by changing their primary crops to less water-intensive crops, and importing things such as cereals, with high virtual-water content, might allow them to alleviate this problem.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Distilled down to its most basic and primitive form, the concept of the Water Footprint is a means of measuring and expressing both the direct and indirect water use of a country, a consumer, or a producer. This essay will mainly strive to explain the differences in the water footprints of developed and developing nations, and will touch on other areas related to this, including: a brief history and explanation of the Water Footprint concept, along with both its basic function and the concept of “virtual water”; also, outside of outlining the differences in the water footprints of nations, I will also examine the usefulness of these figures as economic and environmental indicators, before finishing with an examination of the criticism and limitations of the water footprint concept.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Introduced by Arjen Hoekstra in the early 2000s (Hoekstra and Hung, 2002), the Water Footprint concept was inspired by the similar Footprint concepts introduced around the same time, mainly the ecological footprint (Rees, 1992, p. 121-130). The water footprint is an alternative indicator of water use, and an application of the concept of Virtual Water (coined by John Anthony Allan in 1993), which is the water used in the manufacture and transport of a good or service (e.g., a one litre bottle of water has a virtual water content of nine litres, the amount consumed in its making).  After its initial introduction, it was further refined by Hoekstra, and his colleagues at the UNESCO-IHE, with a 2004 UNESCO report, &lt;i&gt;Water Footprint of Nations, &lt;/i&gt;outlining the most elaborate means of accounting water footprint. One of the main components of this is the concept of different categories of water: White, meaning potable; Grey, meaning water that been degraded; and finally black, meaning sewage or effluent, water completely unfit for human consumption, and potentially lethal. There are also two categories of water usage: blue, representing water for drinking; and green, meaning water intended for irrigation. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;With the increased demand for water, these concepts are now incredibly useful for water resource management. Although there is, in theory, 26 times more water per person on this planet (the average runoff (i.e., rainfall that doesn’t evaporate) is 53 cubic metres per day per person, but the average amount used is 2 cubic metres per day per person.), water is still a huge international problem. Countries with less than 500 cubic metres/year/person are judged to have a scarcity of water (Drew, 2010). Even in developed countries like China or the United States of America, there can be huge discrepancies in runoff and water supply between regions, in spite of the use of modern, cutting-edge irrigation (Saeger, 2009). These regional discrepancies in United States and other countries, have always existed, and accompanying disputes over water, e.g., the Hetch-Hetchy dispute of the 1900s (Righter, 2005) have been a constant part of the political landscape, but in recent years, and gradually over the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, population in the water-scarce areas has increased both in real terms and as a proportion of the general population (US Census Bureau, various). When taken in concert with the increasing globalization of water (Jordan, for example, a relatively affluent middle-eastern state, imports 7 times more water than it uses from domestic sources (Yorke, 2009)), this could have major ramifications for the world, and in the coming years water resource management will become increasingly important for society, and it has been agreed by experts that most water crises and conflicts result not from actual, physical scarcity but from poor management of resources (Aldaya et al., 2008).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Historically, water shortages were viewed as a local problem, their scope extending no further than the applicable river basin, and, historically, this may have been the case. However, with the advent of globalization it is no longer the case, with it being possible for people in one country to affect the water system in another far-off nation, through a variety of ways. A perfect example is the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in the mid-1980s. It had a devastating impact on the surrounding area (Smith, 2005) , but this nuclear accident in Eastern Europe also had far-reaching effects globally, and a study published in Nature (Smith, et al, 2000) demonstrated it had affected water and fish as far away as Scandinavia and the United Kingdom.  &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;The main goal of this essay is to take two countries, one developed, one developing, and analyse and compare their water footprints. For this, I have chosen two neighbouring countries, separated by only thirteen kilometres of the Mediterranean Sea: Spain, and Morocco.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;When examining the water usage of a country, there are three categories that have traditionally been used: Domestic, Agricultural, and Industrial. Although adding these together can give a general impression of a country’s water usage and demand, but as explained earlier with the concept of Virtual Water, in the era of globalization, not only is much of the water consumed used to make products and services that will be exported, but many of the goods used by consumers will originate from foreign countries (Hoekstra and Champaign, 2008). Thus examining the water footprint of a given country involves not only measuring consumption of water for domestic and agricultural use, but also taking into account the virtual water value of goods that are both imported and exported.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Spain makes, in the words of Alberto Garrido and his colleagues, an “ideal case study for an in-depth analysis of virtual water and water footprint”, and was the first to utilize water footprint analysis as a key component of government policy. A developed nation, Spain is also by far the most arid in the European Union, and water resource management is crucial for its continued prosperity. It has one of the largest water footprints in the world, and its arid climate presents a major challenge in water resource management, and analysis of the Spanish situation and resulting response can afford insight into the formation and application of water policy, especially for similarly arid nations, and much can be learned about facilitating efficient use of water. Despite the arid climate, Spain has a far smaller water import dependency than neighbouring E.U. countries, although it is twice as high as Morocco’s (Spain’s figure stands at 36%, Morocco’s at 15%, while Italy, Germany, and Portugal all have a water import dependency above 50% (Water Footprint Network, 1997-2001).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;However, in agriculture, Spain is a net importer of virtual water, and its agriculture consists primarily of crops with high, intensive blue-water demand and relatively low yield, but with livestock, it is a net water exporter. For Spain, the recent trend is for the majority of water consumption to be “blue”, rather than “green”, and the proportion of blue usage has grown over time. In 1997, 51% of water consumption was for “blue” purposes, but by 2005, that percentage had grown to 75% (Garrido, et. al, 2008). In the same study just referenced, Garrido and company propose that water productivity is dependent on two main factors: the ratio of blue/green water usage, and water scarcity. Generally, Spain’s water footprint has risen and fallen consistently with levels of agricultural water use, as industrial and urban water footprints have remained remarkably steady.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;On the surface, the situations and water footprints of Morocco and Spain appear to have much in common. Both are arid countries on the periphery of their continents, and both are, agriculturally at least, net water importers, with Morocco importing, over the timeframe 1997-2001, 6.3 billion cubic meters of water a year (mostly in the form of food and agricultural commodities), compared to a water export of 1.6 billion cubic meters a year. Nearly half of this figure resulted from cereal imports, which account for 3.0 billion cubic meters of that figure, with an additional 1.7 billion cubic meters resulting from the import of oil crops (Hoekstra and Champaign, 2008). In Morocco, water is a scarce commodity, and given that, it makes sense that the export figure would be so low, as most water would go towards feeding people within Morocco, with only about 4% of total agricultural water use in Morocco going towards products for export. By contrast, Spain, although it’s agricultural water imports greatly exceed its exports, uses just over a quarter of its agricultural water for export crops (Garrido, et al, 2008); from an economic standpoint, it might be interesting to find out how high the yield per unit of water used is for these exported crops. I was able to find currency/unit water values for crops in Spain (Garrido, et al, 2008), but was unable to find out what proportion of each crop was exported, and whether the exports had a significantly different value than had they been sold within Spain. Industrial crops had a very low value (less than €.5/cubic meter), while the value for vineyards were 8 times higher, with olives staying consistent around €1/cubic meter. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;From &lt;i&gt;The Globalization of Water&lt;/i&gt; (Hoekstra and Champaign, 2008), we can see that Morocco’s main crop exports are oil crops and fruit, which, by the Spanish values, have a relatively high currency/unit value. A large proportion of their exports are in the form of cereal exports to Libya. Cereals are water-intensive crops, so one might question the wisdom of such farming, especially given Morocco’s scarce water supply. In Spain, however, the Andalusian region in the south is the main contributor of exports. Andalusia’s main crops are cereals and olives (Junta de Andalucía, 2008), and recently there has been large growth in organic farming. Given the reputation of Spanish olive oil, as well as the premium placed upon organically farmed products, one can assume that Andalusian exports have a high currency/unit value.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Also, unlike Morocco, Spain has a much larger through-trade, meaning imported products which are in turn exported again. This means a large proportion (the virtual water value for export of imported products is about 66% of that for export of domestic crops) of Spain’s virtual water export actually originates from outside the country, whereas for Morocco, this number is negligible. This difference is evident of the great economic divide between a developed and a developing nation. While both nations have large per capita water footprints (Morocco’s is 1,477 cubic meters/year, while Spain’s is 2,000) and indeed Morocco’s per capita water footprint is twice as large as that of the Netherlands, examining the nature of their net import/export of virtual water, and their agricultural footprint, speaks volumes about their differences. Despite their similar climates and crop portfolios, it is clear that they are on completely different economic terms. The most telling figure, of these, is the proportion of virtual water export that originates from foreign nations. While Spain’s figure is quite high, especially considering their booming industry in low water-intensity, high-value crops such as citrus fruits and grapes, Morocco’s is tiny, and practically non-existent, due to the evaporative demand of the arid climate, and also Morocco’s low agricultural yield: Moroccan crops have massive water demands: while European maize can have a virtual water content as low as 400 cubic meters/ton, Moroccan maize has a virtual water content of 12,600 cubic meters/ton, while Spanish virtual water content is more in line with global averages (Novo, et al, 2008).&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Although they are both at different stages of economic development, however, Spain and Morocco are both faced with water scarcity, and in the coming years, they will tackle similar water problems, and they will both need to find a more efficient way to allocate water resources, and come up with real water savings; in Spain’s case, to maintain their position as an economic power; in Morocco’s case, to continue their economic development. Morocco would benefit from re-focusing its agricultural sector on crops with low water-demands, and then importing the high virtual-water content crops, like maize, from temperate countries where the virtual water content of these crops is lower. Spain, too, can benefit from a similar policy, focusing more of its agricultural water on low-demand, high-yield crops, and importing high-demand, low-yield crops, which currently account for 60% of all blue water use in Spain, while only accounting for 5% of agricultural Gross Value Added (Hoekstra and Champaign, 2008). These allocations of water are grossly inefficient, and especially troubling for arid countries with water scarcity such as Morocco and Spain. However, through increased international trade, and a better, more efficient apportionment of water for agricultural use, they can easily face these problems.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Cathal Murphy, 2011&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 115%;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;References&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 18px;"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11.5pt; line-height: 115%;"&gt;Hoekstra, A.Y., and P.Q.

The Uncharted 3 beta is fucked. When I try to play it, it tells me it needs to update, then restarts my console. I’m not really excited about it though. I find it hard to really get any feelings going about the Uncharted series. Uncharted 2 was decent, but the game I played was far removed from the one described to me in reviews both professional and amateur. The action sequences were intense, yes (and the cold open (heh, pun) was a beautiful thing), but Nathan Drake himself was so… offputting. Part of this problem comes from the nature of the game itself (Drake’s “revelations” are triggered by your position on the map, rather than the position of your camera), but also the dialogue. Nathan Drake is a smug prick. He’s not as bad as his carbon copy, Inept Villain Sidekick (whoops spoilers although if you’re reading this you’ve either finished Uncharted 2 or are never going to play it) though. The only likeable character in the entire game is the love interest, who seems to have been taken from a better game with better writing. Everyone else is ctrl+v’d from Indiana Jones or one of the rip-offs of same.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: 0px;"&gt;Uncharted 2 was such a relatively unsatisfying experience because occasionally I’d catch glimpses of greatness. The rooftop helicopter battle, the entire temple puzzle section. Mostly though, 2 moments at the end, one in the cutscene before the final boss battle that crystallised one of the funniest things about video game morality (Drake is essentially taking this guy down because he kills people senselessly, and he’s doing this in a game that gives you trophies for kill milestones, like certain methods and weapons, and the villain ethers Drake), and the actual game ending, a genuinely hilarious exchange between Likeable Love Interest and Drake (who all my dudes seem to have man-crushes on for some reason, like WHY?), which is effortless and lived-in and so much better than all the forced one-liners Drake throws at you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: 0px;"&gt;I had other problems with the game too, like argh taking Marco Polo seriously makes me so angry FUCK YOU NAUGHTY DOG even though look suspension of disbelief I know but this is one of my things, Marco Polo being a fraud. One of those fraudulent “facts” (like Eskimos have 100 words for snow how weird is that guys) that’s utterly bogus. While I was playing the game I just imagined that people were trolling Drake for being a tool and believing Polo's bullshit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="margin-top: 10px; outline-color: initial; outline-style: none; outline-width: 0px;"&gt;RATING: 7/10 THIS GAME IS CHILL IF YOU WANT TO KILL TIME I BORROWED IT OFF MY FRIEND ROB FOR FREE BUT I PROBABLY WOULDN’T PAY RRP FOR IT.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/07/broken-beta.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3935717039217829436'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3935717039217829436'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-2674927545753630057</id><published>2011-06-27T13:53:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-27T13:55:55.883+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>Amazon</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2674927545753630057'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2674927545753630057'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-3728775868175837095</id><published>2011-06-14T14:56:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-19T23:06:56.236+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Internet Hilarity'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The Disconnect, or, Dude, I've Seen You Hit on Ladies, and It is The Saddest Thing</title><content type='html'>Butthurt has happened. Not since I got another Dundalk Internet Personality similarly lacking in self-awareness &lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5726625/Timestamped.JPG"&gt;to display his maturity over twitter&lt;/a&gt; (Damn, I should have screencapped the whole exchange, the hypocrisy he displayed was a thing of beauty, a tour de force of self-ignorance normally only witnessed by GOP leadership over in the States), because he was pissed off that I was criticizing him for interfering in someone else's business, has there been a display of self-aggrandizing bullshit so beautiful. What unites these 2 individuals isn't their tragic lack of self-awareness, but rather the disconnect between how they view themselves, and how they actually are. The individual whose mature tweet has been screencapped included in his twitter bio the line "I don't follow, I lead". The individual whose rump is currently ravished recently made a blog post complaining that people weren't reacting to things the way he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5726625/Music%20Used%20To%20Mean%20Something%20%20%20One%20Fool%20and%20a%20Keyboard.htm"&gt;My comment which sparked all this shit is available here.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;His blog post, "I Made a Mistake", is also worth reading, and it is rich in Essential Internet Arguments, like THAT'S JUST MY OPINION, and LOL DEFENDING MY SHIT IS TOO MUCH EFFORT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Information Bro, a dude who I value most highly as a friend, has been keeping me abreast of the anal swelling currently befalling the blogger I wronged, and it is most entertaining. On his counsel however, the ethering of the blogger in question, and his resultant buttfrustration, will be saved for a later post, which will deal more with Internet Arguments and Logical Fallacies. This post, however, is inspired by that same blogger, (who won't be identified because, well, he doesn't deserve the publicity. To quote Mobute Sese Seko, he has "face for radio, voice for text, thoughts for semaphore), and concerns the disconnect between how these people portray themselves to browsers, and how they actually behave. Now to keep it fair I'll also be mentioning the &lt;a href="http://callkennyloggins.wordpress.com/"&gt;blog of someone I actually like&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What unites The Danger Zone with The Rumpravished is their portrayal of their sex life. The former's is slightly inaccurate, but in a way that makes him more sympathetic (think Vriska in Homestuck), while the latter's description of it bears no resemblance to observed reality. Zone portrays himself as a kind of cold lothario, bedding the ladies haphazardly and without abandon. Now, he does get more play than Mario Chalmers, but at the same time, the coldness doesn't vibe with what is observed. However, this, as stated before, makes him more sympathetic, as the suppression of emotion for fear of showing vulnerability is a human action to which many can relate. The Rumpravished on the other hand, often makes casual references to his relationships (it is implied there have been numerous), and to talking to the ladies (he mentions his blog during his flirtations...), while by all accounts, he strikes out more than Mark Reynolds. As someone who has witnessed perhaps the 2 biggest strikeouts, and his subsequent reaction to them, I find his account of his love-life both unrealistic and goddamned hilarious. I'd describe them, but frankly the two girls in question would be embarrassed by association with him, and that would be mean, but more importantly, they wouldn't have acted in a way that provoked such an ethering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the latter case, the disconnect between his account of reality and reality itself is jarring. And behaviour like that is becoming hella common, and also &lt;a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20110613/wl_uk_afp/syriapoliticsunrestgayinternetbritainus"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/blogpost/post/paula-brooks-editor-of-lez-get-real-also-a-man/2011/06/13/AGld2ZTH_blog.html"&gt;ridiculous&lt;/a&gt;, and in the former example, &lt;a href="http://shortformblog.tumblr.com/post/6488470470/syria-gay-girl-damascus-hoax"&gt;actively harmful to Syrian bloggers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a_1UEAGCo30"&gt;While the move away from online anonymity worries me&lt;/a&gt;, what's sad is how people are using social networking to portray themselves as things they are not. This isn't a case of repeating something until it's true either, because these blogs offer spheres of positive affirmation, allowing people to convince themselves that they somehow are the person they describe in their blog, rather than say a Ohioan adopting his wife's identity and pretending to be a lesbian, or a self-important blogger pretending to be respected and successful with his preferred sex. It is often the first advice proffered on self-improvement threads on Reddit and 4chan, and it is true that if you pretend to be something enough, you will eventually become it, but with these fictional personas, it's not the case. It simply exacerbates one's negative qualities, like say an inability to handle criticism, and turns them into virtues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the real world one would either have to acknowledge or refute any critiques of their behaviour, but in the blogosphere, they don't have to. They can screen their comments so visitors only see praise and affirmation (the blogger who sparked this post), or not allow comments at all, in case people are able to skewer them in ways not everyone will get (any number of conservative youtubers, like &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MddREczVeL4"&gt;Wolverines, a horrible "rap" group&lt;/a&gt;. Read the top comment on that video, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzpSbGgDx_w"&gt;and then listen to the diss, by the excellent Satellite High&lt;/a&gt;, to get an example of the kind of behaviour I'm talking about. Wolverines don't allow Made You Look Stupid to become an official response, and can then complain about being victimized by liberals, safe in the knowledge that they don't have to risk people hearing the diss and realising what a bunch of tools they are). Honestly this kind of sheltered life, carefully censoring criticism (in both of the examples (I ethered the Rumpravished, and the beautiful carnage is posted above, I would say that it's pretty hard to fault the critiques, perhaps they maybe get personal, but those are the terms the bloggers and the youtubers set, and those are the terms on which they were destroyed), and cherry-picking from any negative responses to portray yourself as a noble, victimised man speaking truth to power and getting hated by prejudiced individuals because YOU'RE JUST EXPRESSING OPINIONS, and even if those opinions are ignorant, bigoted, and demonstably wrong, then criticism amounts to attempts at censorship (double points if the post which sparked everything recommends censorship as a way of upholding moral order). It's fucking pathetic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I'm gonna drop the sign-off. It was just a way of avoiding having to write structured conclusions to my shit.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/06/disconnect-or-dude-ive-seen-you-hit-on.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3728775868175837095'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3728775868175837095'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-48720160589520845</id><published>2011-06-07T23:10:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-07T23:13:21.512+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>The internet is without an erase tool: An ode to defunct blogs for which I hold great affection</title><content type='html'></content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/48720160589520845'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/48720160589520845'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7512549891448333744</id><published>2011-06-02T15:06:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2011-06-02T15:06:34.868+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Franklin &amp; Bash</title><content type='html'></content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7512549891448333744'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7512549891448333744'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7316155238025947551</id><published>2011-06-01T18:51:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.472+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Catching up'/><title type='text'>Bounce Up Like Roundball</title><content type='html'>It's been just over 2 months since I last posted on here. A lot of things have happened. I've taken exams. I've read blogs. Stupid blogs. Smart blogs. I've seen good blogs fall victim to self-importance and wrong-headedness, and great blogs see their content stream reduced to a trickle. I've read blogs that may well have been stupid, but since they were written by illiterates, I couldn't tell. I've read stupid blogs by people who think themselves smart. I've had a quick look at about three quarters of all blogs by Blogspot users listing their location as Dundalk, Louth, Ireland. About 6 had a significant amount of content, and of those 6, 2 were readable. You can look forward to a quick rundown of the high- and low-lights of the Dundalk blogging scene later this summer. There are very few highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other things happened too, Miami Heat fans became even more ignorant and insufferable; Russell Westbrook became hated; Phil Jackson got swept for the first time as a coach, and the second time total (his last season with the Knicks ended with them being swept by the Sixers); the Cavs apparently decided the top two picks in a weak draft were something worth having; J.R. Smith got some kind of traffic charge while on his scooter, and TMZ decided to make it a race thing; Yes it has been an exciting playoffs/offseason in the NBA. Momentous sea-changing events everywhere. But not just in basketball has this been the case. A brief rundown of things I thought worth comment during the hiatus, sorted randomly, rather than by some rational metric, like time of occurrence, or relative importance:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lauren Faust left her position on &lt;i&gt;My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic&lt;/i&gt;, which has been the biggest and most pleasant surprise of the last 12 months in television. It's probably not going to affect the quality that much, since she only actually wrote a handful of elements, and will still be involved in Season 2 in an advisory capacity. Still, it is a shame. I'd worry about merchandising influencing the show's direction, but the merchandise for &lt;i&gt;MLP:FiM&lt;/i&gt; and the show itself exist in entirely different space-time continua, so it's not really a concern.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Playstation Network went down in mid-late April, and it's still not fully functioning. EA have jumped the gun and put up announcements regarding new items available in the Store, including a "Welcome Back" event regarding&lt;i&gt; FIFA 11&lt;/i&gt;'s Ultimate Team mode.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;HMV tried really hard to rid themselves of all copies of &lt;i&gt;Shogun 2: Total War&lt;/i&gt;. Their last copy was priced at €18 as of yesterday (for comparison, €50 on Steam, €30 on Amazon.co.uk).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A year living with a fervent racist has given me a heightened awareness of casual racism. Mostly I find this newly-noticed casual racism hilarious. My favourite example was a guy a couple of years back saying he disliked Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas because he found the concept of a man from the "hood" (the quotation marks were his own) owning a casino far too unrealistic. Incidentally, there is &lt;a href="http://blackamericans.com/blogs/news/archive/2007/12/13/for-casino-owner-winning-a-license-was-not-a-matter-of-luck.aspx"&gt;one black casino owner&lt;/a&gt; in the U.S., hailing from Detroit (no doubt the individual who made the comment would consider any predominately black area to be a "hood").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Conservative media outlets kicked up a massive fuss over Common (you know, from the Queen Latifah movies and the Gap ads) being invited to the White House for a poetry reading. He is a "thug" you see, although anybody who knows Common professionally or personally, or for that fact listens to his music, knows that is hilarious bullshit. During this coverage, Fox News displayed their lack of object permanence, criticizing this "thug" rapper who they had recently praised for being, well, a not-thug. The low-point of the conversative media's coverage of this event was &lt;a href="http://dailycaller.com/2011/05/09/burn-a-bush-michelle-obama-invites-rapper-common-to-a-poetry-reading/"&gt;this gem right here&lt;/a&gt;, where the writer deliberately misspells Common's lyrics, because hey that's how thugs (read: black people) talk, right?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zack Ryder blew the fuck up like he was supposed to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Andrew Breitbart continued to be an irredeemable shithead, lacking any semblance of integrity.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A rap collective called OFWGYMCA captured the imaginations of hipsters everywhere. Their main producer, Tyler, the Creator, released an album recently, and I will be reviewing it later in the week. Another member of the group, Frank Ocean, also will be getting a physical release for his debut work, &lt;i&gt;Nostalgia,Ultra.&lt;/i&gt;, which thus far is, along with &lt;i&gt;James Blake&lt;/i&gt;, and&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Greatest Story Never Told&lt;/i&gt;, one of my top three albums of 2011.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reddit continued to have server trouble. It's continuous uptime record now stands at 8 days. Yay!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The x key came off my laptop's keyboard. The key itself still works, but I now have to press down on the sensor, which I occasionally miss, given that I've been used to having a tactile button there for 2 years now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;Portal 2&lt;/i&gt; was released. There has been no news on &lt;i&gt;Half Life: Episode 3&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Republican Party failed to produce one viable presidential candidate. They still have time though, I'm sure Chris Christie will fly in and save the day.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started playing basketball again, and finally developed a jumper that occasionally gets points. I've also finished one of the items on my summer list: Beat my brother in a game of 1-on-1 (I won 8-6).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I started a &lt;a href="http://www.myacehen.tumblr.com/"&gt;tumblr&lt;/a&gt;. Mostly because two of my favourite bloggers, &lt;a href="http://www.mrdestructo.tumblr.com/"&gt;Mobute Sese Seko&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.bethlehemshoals.tumblr.com/"&gt;Bethlehem Shoals&lt;/a&gt;, started blogging there, and the tumblr dashboard is actually quite usable. I now follow a couple of poni blogs, &lt;a href="http://skepticarcher.tumblr.com/"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://shoushutup.tumblr.com/"&gt;also&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://mimicre.tumblr.com/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://natazilla.tumblr.com/"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://emmyc.tumblr.com/"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://vickybit.tumblr.com/"&gt;artist&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://lexxercise.tumblr.com/"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt; (in that they are run by artists, but are not exclusively for art) that are, for the most part, in some way related to Homestuck, either directly or tangentially.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the artists linked above, &lt;a href="http://emmyc.tumblr.com/"&gt;Emmy Cicierega&lt;/a&gt;, has a book called &lt;i&gt;The Balloon Adventure&lt;/i&gt;, which is one of the best things I have read since going to college. It's a wordless comic, and it's a transcendant comic. Her brother, Neil, did &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygI-2F8ApUM"&gt;Brodyquest&lt;/a&gt;, which is also amazing, for different reasons.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of the writers linked above, &lt;a href="http://bethlehemshoals.tumblr.com/"&gt;Bethlehem Shoals&lt;/a&gt;, was one of the minds behind FreeDarko, a sublime basketball blog which closed shop early April. &lt;a href="http://www.freedarkostore.bigcartel.com/"&gt;It's store is still open&lt;/a&gt;, and there you can find fantastic prints, and you can also purchase the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/FreeDarko-Presents-Undisputed-Basketball-History/dp/1608190838/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1306948847&amp;amp;sr=8-1"&gt;&lt;i&gt;FreeDarko Undisputed Guide to Basketball History&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on amazon. I haven't read it yet, but that shit is on it's way to my location, and I am very excited to receive it. Shoals is currently &lt;a href="http://www.gq.com/blogs/the-q/sports/nba-playoffs/"&gt;blogging the NBA Playoffs over at GQ&lt;/a&gt;, with the help of luminaries such as David Roth, and Carles (of "Hipster Runoff").&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Foster Wallace's final book, the unfinished novel &lt;i&gt;The Pale King&lt;/i&gt;, was released. I picked up a copy in the Dundalk library, and am currently in the process of reading it. Since I own near on the entire Wallace bibliography in paperback, I didn't want to muss it up by buying his final work in hardcover. It just wouldn't fit. But the book is great, albeit not as great as &lt;i&gt;Consider the Lobster&lt;/i&gt;, one of the greatest essay collections ever published.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jack Warner fell on the sword so that Sepp Blatter could secure another term as FIFA President. &lt;a href="http://www.independent.ie/sport/soccer/blatter-promises-fifa-reform-2654846.html"&gt;Blatter ran on a platform of reform&lt;/a&gt;. It isn't even funny anymore.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Butler Bulldogs made yet another underdog run to the NCAA Championship, and then had one of the worst performances by any team in the Men's D-1 Basketball Championship game, ever.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;David Norris made some comments regarding paedophilia a decade ago, and they've been brought up again. I don't need to tell you what connections people are going to make.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Barack Obama and the Queen visited. Pissy republicans (you're not alone, America, our Republicans are 95% idiots too!) tried to protest the latter, by flipping people off and saying she was wanted for war crimes. It was hilarious. Sinn Fein decided Aengus ó Snodaigh would best represent them on television. He made an ass of himself. During the Obama visit, I went to a pub and met some Mitch Daniels voters.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I planned out dozens of blog posts for the next three months, so if you're one of the dozen or so people who visited in the last two months, you have much to look forward to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's a decent, mostly apolitical recap of the last two months (getting into the politics would take another 10,000 words and several broken keyboards). I've updated my blogroll on the side, including the best baseball blog (Pitchers &amp;amp; Poets), and the best general/political blog (Et tu, Mr. Destructo?). Check those out. They're a lot better than this blog.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Every time I hit the ground,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/06/bounce-up-like-roundball.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7316155238025947551'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7316155238025947551'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-2427620505982009693</id><published>2011-03-28T03:49:00.005+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.451+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lists'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Hiatus'/><title type='text'>The Season Finale</title><content type='html'>I have stuck with the Seasons plan, as it turns out. 4-5 months on, 2 months off. So I should be back at the tail end of May, although I might post a Detox review in April if it actually comes out. I actually posted a lot this month, my most prolific of the "season", with 16 posts including this one. Actually I have a bunch of stuff planned for My Ace Hen Season 3, including:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A bunch of reviews of rap albums nobody really cares about&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Def Jux retrospective&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Blog posts about cookies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reviews of other stuff, like &lt;i&gt;The Pale King&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Legend of Korra&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More posts about the dull minutiae of my life&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cookies&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn't entirely sure how exactly how to finish this up, so I'm just going to list off some observations and memories and such that I have collected over the past week. A kind of montage sequence, fitting for the ending of a season as glorious as the second season of My Ace Hen, which was way better than the first, which let's not talk about that. I might at some point update the archive to reflect the season categories, once I find out how to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, before we get to the collected observations, I made "covers" as such for the My Ace Hen seasons, using pictures of Marceline playing a guitar and the Pittsburgh Pirates smoking, respectively. This new post editor has made posting and placing these images a lot easier. Thanks Google/Blogger! The first, obviously, represents the short posts of the first season, which were often simply about myself, and were often quite melancholic. The picture I chose makes me very sad. Marceline is one of my favourite Adventure Time characters. The second picture is some baseball players sitting around and smoking and (presumably) talking some old bullshit. Which is pretty much what the second season was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;My most peaceful memory is climbing a mountain at 6a.m., with Christine's two dogs, and fondly regarding the magnificent vista before me. I didn't sleep that night, and on the way down I listened to Blood on the Tracks. I ate Coco Pops out of a brandy snifter. I watched Fresh Prince and witnessed two straight men spooning in a manner that was vaguely post-coital. Or post-broital, in that case. I myself have never spooned anyone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I should probably be taking more risks. How badly can you embarrass yourself with someone you've only met once?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This year, there have been opportunities I have let pass by. But, for the most part, I have taken up every offer which it was possible for me to take. This has been a good thing, I will continue doing this.&amp;nbsp;One exception was the Drawing with Don night, which I totally should have gone to.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I am quite fond of my beard, I think generally I don't find them attractive on other people. I can't think of why this is.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;More organizations should follow the NCAA's lead, and allow for free international streaming of sporting events. Nothing is lost by the NBA if they, say, allow me to stream games on their website from Ireland. In fact one might argue they would gain from such practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Dreamcast failed because it was ahead of it's time. It should have also had a DVD drive, rather than using that proprietary format, which ironically, although it's creation was partially motivated by piracy concerns, ended up being the format for the console that is pretty much the easiest ever to pirate games for. On any Dreamcast model produced before a certain date (late in the console's life span, if I recall correctly) you can play any burned disc straight up with no fancy mathematics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Today I found a red lightsaber on the beach. Later, I saw a child walking around with a blue one. I was reminded of my brother and I as young children. On the rare occasion (about twice a year tops) we went to McDonalds, we would always be given the same Happy Meal toy. My brother guessed this was a ploy on the part of staff to prevent sibling jealousies and rivalries. This seems uncharacteristically compassionate and complex for McDonalds staff. Not that they are stupid, but I always assumed they didn't care that much. I'm guessing the people who did this though (it was the McDonalds in Drogheda) turned out to be great parents.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;As a child, I thought Star Wars and Star Trek to be the same thing. I watched and enjoyed Star Trek before Star Wars. The Star Trek reboot was a massive improvement on a decent work, but the Star Wars reboot was a desecration of a classic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ask me about my Gilmore Girls impression.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Howth is a beautiful place, out of a picture book. Today, someone said they pity people who have never seen the sea. I endorse this sentiment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have never understood the appeal of Aerosmith.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sometimes jokingly place blame for my issues as such on my Catholicism. Really, I think it has little do with it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The main purpose of welfare should be to help people get back to paying taxes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A government should, at the very least, enforce contracts and ensure people's rights are not denied.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Very little can be done about climate change at this point, except maybe hope for a big volcanic eruption somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Once, when asked what their most controversial opinion was, someone said he found it incredibly selfish when humans campaigned against climate change of their own making. I found I couldn't really argue with him.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;It is a mistake to think of evolution as directed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am still sometimes very awkward around new friends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I downloaded a Frisky Dingo torrent today. It came with a file called "The Libertarian Socialist Revolution.txt". I'll say what I said about the Obama Little Big Planet levels. Surely there's a better way of getting your message out.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To ensure your drug use does not fund organised crime, buy only homegrown marijuana from people you know personally. Their seeds have mostly likely come from legitimate organisations which concern themselves with the trafficking of said seeds, rather than sex workers or general near-slave labour.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are people with whom I was once very close, who would probably not acknowledge me were I to pass them on the street today. There was no falling out in these cases, and I find it surreal that we were once so familiar.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, there are people with whom my familiarity has risen and fallen over the years. Actually, I can only think of one person this applies to. We once went nearly a year without talking, but I would like to think that before and after that year, we were and are good friends.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If I could own three albums on vinyl, they would be &lt;i&gt;Loveless&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;Funcrusher Plus&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Blood on the Tracks.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sometimes, if I catch myself thinking something less than wholesome, I will then think something really unspeakably horrible, and check around to make sure nobody is reading my thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am very psyched for Wrestlemania this year, even though I am not a huge fan of Pro Wrestling.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think of different first person shooters as slightly varied rule sets for the same sport, in a manner analogous to house rules for Monopoly.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I think Odd Future are alright, I simply don't get the big deal everyone is making about them. To me it just seems to be dickriding of the most whorish degree. Their Funny or Die video was painfully clichéd unfunny. I have high hopes for their Adult Swim pilot though.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I don't understand the smoking of cigarettes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The nicest whiskey I've ever had was 70% a.b.v. proof cooking whiskey, whose label simply read WHISKEY in large type, and, proof aside, had basically no information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I was young, I was so into flags I got into trouble for it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am also really psyched for the Final Four. I love the underdogs in sports.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;On the other hand, I really hate Cristiano Ronaldo, who I will never refer to as "Ronaldo" because he will never be the best player by that name.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Trying to stand out in a large college class is like trying to stand out in a Brazilian football tryout.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have hidden over half of my Facebook friends list from my news feed, and since I have done so, I have been a lot happier generally.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;You could get a bike for a million pokedollars, but you would never get this much money no matter how long you played for.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A Facebook 'dislike' button is a terrible idea, and it shouldn't be hard to figure out why.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;My 4chan usage has decreased as my "Average hours socializing a week" has increased.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I once ran an mp3 blog called Running Dog for a week. I used to troll forums with that name on Highway67.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;There are 3 people who owe me money. They gots to pay soon.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Baking is great for relieving stress.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I hate who I was 2 years ago. Who I was 2 years ago hated who I was 4 years ago. And so on.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;After using good earphones, cheap iBuds just seem terrible and unusable.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Skullcandy is bad and you should feel bad.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I really enjoyed Monster Rancher growing up.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I feel awesome when someone comments on my blog.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Although I haven't played it, I think &lt;i&gt;Magicka&lt;/i&gt;'s spellcasting system is genius.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Peter King. Cristiano Ronaldo. Tim Buckley. They are all names on my List of Terrible People.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I simply don't understand the behaviour of Ghaddafi's (sp?) forces currently. Surely they realise they've set themselves on a slope towards Not Being in Power?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I would be very surprised if the woman they raped and called a traitor at the journalist's hotel is still alive.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Khadafi is too terrible even for the List of Terrible People.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I am not sure if I am capable of the constant emotional and physical effort needed (extrapolating from experiences in shorter relationships) for a long-term relationship.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I think people who cheat are not cool. If you are in a position where you cheat why not just end the relationship before the fact?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have made a papercraft Weighted Companion Cube. For science.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I eagerly await shorts weather.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;When I started this blog I did not have a beard.

Sure I thought Superstar and that song from his first album that sampled Travis were pretty dope, but it kind of stopped there. I still have his first 2 albums and that manifesto/mixtape thing on my iPod (actually another track of his I like is &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2wI8yjNPcA"&gt;his rap over The National Anthem&lt;/a&gt;). I mean this album has been out a while and I haven't even bothered downloading it until now. But thanks to the lovely fellows at RapGodfathers, I now have a copy, without the iTunes bonus tracks, so I'm going to review it and see if it is indeed as bad as everyone says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Letting Go (feat. Sarah Green) (produced by King David)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eh this has a nice start, but then about 25 seconds in it goes downhill. Sarah Green actually had spots on his last 2 albums actually. The chorus is kind of catchy. The rapping is also mildly impressive, in that C-student backpacker kind of way. It seems to be entirely about the label trouble surrounding the release of Lasers. Meta! This chorus is actually really excellent. There's a weird intercom-effect on the vocal track too, reminiscent of Gorgeous off Kanye's last album, and to a lesser extent, Krazy Kings. Actually this commentary on a controversy on the object of controversy itself reminds me of Nas's&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Untitled. &lt;/i&gt;Also, apparently his Uzi weighs a ton. But this is a really excellent chorus. It sounds like it's transplanted from a latter-day Eminem song. Sarah Green's spot at the end on the other hand is pretty irritating. Overall this is a good start.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Words I Never Said (feat. Skylar Grey) (produced by Alex da Kid)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mentioned Eminem in the last one, and speak of the devil this song has Skylar Grey, who wrote the chorus for Love the Way You Lie, and sings the chorus on that new Dr. Dre song that sucks and has Eminem. I really don't like her voice. Hey more nice sounding piano. The beat isn't terrible, again it sounds like something that could have been on &lt;i&gt;Twisted Fantasy&lt;/i&gt;. Ah balls, it's a political track. Military-Industrial Complex! Budget cuts are bad! Cover-ups! Also a well-phrased couplet about the lack of actual news on the news. And suddenly, the idiot bomb is dropped. He didn't vote for Obama because Obama didn't speak out about something that happened after Obama was elected. I think? He's not voting for Obama in 2012 just so you know. Because he's peaceful. Yeah actually this is produced by Alex da Kid. This could easily fit in on Eminem's next album, maybe it would be better than Mosh, which represents the low point of political rapping. Also some really juvenile rhymes here. Actor/factor and such. The chorus grows on you. It belongs on a song about some failed relationship, not some juvenile faux-profound political shit. The chorus just soars.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Till I Get There (produced by Needlz)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reminds me of Paris Tokyo from &lt;i&gt;The Cool&lt;/i&gt;. Pretty obviously aimed for the charts. More nice sounding piano noises, catchy. Rapping is technically solid, unimpressive. There's not a whole lot to say here. It just kind of floats by without leaving an impression. This could fit in on a romantic comedy soundtrack pretty well. A montage scene where the lead has screwed up in someway, and the montage is about their re-adjusting to life without their soulmate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. I Don't Wanna Care Right Now (feat. MDMA) (produced by The Audibles)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eh. This album is really all over the place philosophically. The rapping here is awful, he ends every few lines with a kind of fake-out thing, incredibly irritating. Attempt at a another chart hit, beat reminiscent of any number of Steve Aoki crew tracks. The verses seem to be hey-mom-watch-this exercises. They fall on their face. Also the guy on the chorus has a vague fake patois going on. Kind of infectious. Again, this chorus would be perfect for another, better song, with another, better rapper. The guest choruses here in general are earworms, which makes sense given that apparently like 8 of the tracks here are just focus-grouped shit that was meant for B.o.B. or something.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Out of My Head (feat. Trey Songz) (produced by Miykal Snoddy)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Trey Songz. He's really scraping the chart-barrel here. Beat sounds like a Homestuck reject. I've actually never heard of 4 of the 5 different producers so far. Again chorus belongs on a different song. He should have gotten R. Kelly on this. Made some Chicago anthem. "You're killing me, I think a need a will in here", sample rhyme. The beat again has an earworm quality. It just burrows in there. I could bug out to this if it didn't have Lupe.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;6. The Show Goes On (produced by Kane Beatz)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Samples Float On. It works, in a cheesy pop-rap kind of way. Of course not a patch on the original. Again this beat should have been given to a better MC. Das Racist, for example, would murder this. Actually, fuck, this beat is fucking amazing. &amp;nbsp;The chorus is too. Fuck, it's just so catchy. Plus since it samples a popular rock song I can troll with it. But seriously, this beat man. This is the first track so far that I could say has replay value. Mixtape staple in years to come, one hopes. Someone else could make this a classic. Make this the 4th Lupe song I like. The lyrics are just some rise-up bullshit, lazy. Kind of a waste. Also, shouldn't a track called The Shows Goes On close out an album? Apparently the label forced this one on him. It actually broke the Top 40 over in the States. He has nothing to say about it. Also apparently he was told not to rap "too deep", as if Lupe Fiasco has ever been truly "deep". That might explain the tired concepts he kicks here. Somebody else get on this please.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;7. Beautiful Lasers (2Ways) (feat. MDMA) (produced by King David)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stadium sound. I'm assuming the songs Lupe salvaged from his vision of &lt;i&gt;Lasers&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;were the ones produced by this guy. The first time so far I could call the rapping good. I wouldn't be averse to hearing the original version of this album. I'm just wanting to listen to The Show Goes On again while I listen to this. The themes and imagery here are not really any better than the "not too deep" raps on The Show Goes On. Again a nice chorus. MDMA doesn't really have the kind of patois twinge here either. Eh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;8. Coming Up (feat. MDMA) (produced by King David)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another Lupe/MDMA/King David team up. Beat is again catchy. Raps are again not. I think he's rapping about the ladies. The chorus feels like a fugitive from 80s hair metal. That's not a good thing. Overall the track reminds me of Thank You off The Blueprint 3, with more coherent rhymes. These beats are actually solid. Just damn solid. They're just crying out for a different MC. Oh wow MDMA is just terrible here. He was good on the other two tracks, but he's just awful here. He kind of redeems himself at the end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;9. State Run Radio (feat. Matt Mahaffey) (produced by King David)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eh I'm really not feeling the beat here. Not at all. Nor am I feeling the singer here. I think he's kicking more political raps. Also, I'm pretty sure that the U.S. military is asking for less cash overall, but facts and a 3-dimensional perception of time, as we discovered earlier, won't silence Lupe the Firebrand! Eh on the whole the raps here are slightly better than on Words I Never Said. But I mean it's still bad. This track can't end fast enough.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;10. Break the Chain (feat. Eric Turner and Sway) (produced by Ishi)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Seems to be another meta-track about the making of the album. The beat has a stop-start thing going on, and Lupe does decent work with it. Beat again sounds like a Steve Aoki cast off. Chorus is woeful. Sway absolutely burns Lupe on this. He is just so much better. Not that it's hard, but he just effortlessly blows Lupe out of the water on it. Come to think of it, that's the first guest verse thus far. Odd. And then Lupe's back, and the track is back to sucking. This is proof positive that these beats deserve better rappers. I'm not even a fan of Sway and I think his verse is way better than Lupe's.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;11. All Black Everything (produced by The Buchanans)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Buchanans had a beat on &lt;i&gt;The Black Album&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;way back when, but I don't recall hearing anything by them since. The beat once again feels like a cast-off from the last Kanye album. In particular, a sped up version of Devil in a New Dress. More political raps I think, this time some afronationalism or something? An alternate history where, as the title suggests, it's All Black Everything, and W.E.B. DuBois writes the constitution. Does he mean like an alternate constitution written in the late 19th century or? Actually I had to look up the lyrics, yes it seems he is suggesting that it is feasible, in this All Black Everything world, for a man born in 1868 to have written the U.S. constitution. Jesus Christ. Well Lupe doesn't listen to the lies they teach people in schools (he mentioned this earlier) so I guess this is consistent with that. These lyrics are woeful. I mean you could maybe write an interesting alternate history novel about this concept, but Lupe butchers it with like woeful WHAT IF bullshit that is certifiably ape-shit ballistic and would be laughed off even the dodgiest althist boards. He also asserts that slavery seemed to have come to Africa borne on slave ships, which, yeah but no. &amp;nbsp;This entire thing is dodgy. Ahmadinejad wins a peace prize (he's not some piece of shit in this timeline I take it) and Bush is in Iran? Huh? This is hilarious. It reminds me of a scene in &lt;i&gt;The Boondocks&lt;/i&gt;, where Thugnificent goes on Bill Maher to reposition himself as a community leader, and makes an ass of himself thanks to complete ignorance of everything. A laugh-riot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;12. Never Forget You (feat. John Legend) (produced by Jerry duPlessis, Syience, and Arden Altino)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Man is John Legend wasted here. For once, Lupe outshines the guest star. The beat has a nice feeling about it, like it belongs in a sports biopic. The chorus here is just weak. The beat on the other hand is decent. It has the aforementioned feeling. Actually several of the tracks on &lt;i&gt;Lasers&lt;/i&gt; feel tailor-made for mid-level studio films. This could actually, given the lyrical content, fit on a romantic comedy also. The big triumphant declaration-of-love scene. I'm guessing this soundtrack quality many of the tracks have is entirely intentional, a way of getting some extra off-the-books income for the label, since they've pretty much dictated the content here, the way Lupe tells it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well that's about it. Overall I mean the album isn't the car crash I was led to believe, but it's still bad. Just bad in a completely nondescript way. Like I can't even remember why it was bad now that it's over, but rather I just remember it being bad. Except The Show Goes On. I'm putting that shit on repeat. Anyway, it would seem that all that selling-out Lupe did for this album paid off, because it sold over 200,000 copies it's first week out, which for a rap album in 2011, is just really fucking impressive. I mean Big Boi made an actual good album and he didn't even break 6 figures opening week. Apparently Lupe has another album (which comes with the subtitle "The Great American Rap Album", which lollerskates) in the works, which, in keeping with the label-mandated trend hopping he is on, is a "sequel", in so far as a non-concept rap album can really have one. I mean this certainly isn't going to make my list of good albums come year end, but it's not going to be on the "How Can You Fucking Suck So Much?" list either. Although it might sound like the beats are good, they're more just catchy, y'know the way mediocre house music is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd give it a C-, or 2.5 stars, or 5/10, if I had to grade it,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/03/lasers.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6160302178243566311'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6160302178243566311'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-3543366462877176177</id><published>2011-03-15T02:43:00.001Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.455+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lists'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Non-Sequiturs'/><title type='text'>Collected errata, or, It's 2 a.m. which is the perfect time to unload some of the bad stuff</title><content type='html'>Today's chemistry lab was basically a practice computer simulation, and my first molecular modelling lab. Honestly, it went fantastically. Normally in my first experiment of a set, I struggle a bit, but this one was all Hells Yeah. I had the actual body of the experiment done in about half an hour, and I felt like a CachE god. And I was able to infer the general rule about pi electrons and chemical reactions too. I AM JUST SO FLY FOR A CHEMISTRY GUY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I gave that &lt;a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/5726625/Chakra%20Roll.png"&gt;4chan Chakra Roll&lt;/a&gt; thing a go, using a random number generator instead of a series of 4chan posts. So I mean I may as well post it here then. Here goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Muladhara: 7) Tell about when you were most afraid in your life&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh man I remember this one. When I was like 11 or 12, me and my brother did some entry-level sailing thing at the Carlingford club relating to the area of sailing. It was a pretty nasty week, horrible weather, terrible seas. But at one point my boat capsized and my lifejacket all fell off and it was like damn. I probably would have been fine but like it was pretty nasty, I was absolutely fucking terrified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Svadhistana: 2) List 5 ways you can be happier&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn't really get this one. There's probably some David Foster Wallace quote that's pertinent, but I can't for the life of me find it. But I can't even try doing this one, I mean 5 ways, it's like why not 100?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manipura: 8) How can understanding your emotions be benificial?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I mean this one is pretty obvious. A deeper understanding of one's own emotions can help both during deliberations over future actions, and in analysis of past mistakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anahata: 5) Tell about a time you were rejected&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I did my leaving cert, I got an interview for admission to Cambridge, which I proceeded to fuck up spectacularly, not that my chances were great to begin with. I didn't get the place anyway, which was kind of a bummer, but in the end I got a course that I very much enjoy, so I mean it worked out all right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vishuddha: 8) How can you turn failure into a learning experience&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm pretty sure I'm goofing on the answers to these types of open-ended questions. Perhaps when I spend more time formulating my thoughts with regards to them I will edit the post to include the superior answers. I probably shouldn't try blogging at 2 in the morning. Hey, I've just turned failure into a learning experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ajna: 2) Tell about a time you benefitted from following instinct&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I'm not entirely sure I can delineate instinct from the other influences on my thought processes, so I have kind of have to cop out here. I mean I think pretty fast I'm not sure how many decisions I made based on following instinct alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sahasrara: 7) Meditate for at least five minutes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was actually pretty fun, and I might do another one again at some point. Chakra roll I mean. As much as I enjoyed my first MM lab, I'm not lining up to do more, although it actually would be enjoyable. Also, HOMO is a chemistry term. It stands for Highest Occupied Molecular Orbital. I now just have to find an image that communicates that concept, and write in NO in comic sans MS, and I've finished my fourth comic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roffles,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/03/collected-errata-or-its-2-am-which-is.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3543366462877176177'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3543366462877176177'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-1475222333755309524</id><published>2011-03-15T00:33:00.002Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.446+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Inspirational Ish'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sports'/><title type='text'>Inspirational Ish with Gilbert Arenas</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://3.gvt0.com/vi/vaepfMuL7k8/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/vaepfMuL7k8&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;embed width="320" height="266" src="http://www.youtube.com/v/vaepfMuL7k8&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;This is fucking excellent.

He's also the source for the quote in my About Me section. Damn, son. Also this video got me listening to Athlete again. Tourist was one of the first albums I bought for myself. I stopped buying albums later. The story behind his original jersey number is also pretty cool. As I remember it, he chose 0 because that's the number of minutes he was told he'd get in college. He went on to become an NBA All-Star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impossible is 0,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/03/inspirational-ish-with-gilbert-arenas.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1475222333755309524'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1475222333755309524'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.gvt0.com/vi/vaepfMuL7k8/0.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-5337526507551167726</id><published>2011-03-12T22:30:00.000Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.467+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Projects'/><title type='text'>Snippets from a text adventure of no consequence</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;A couple of months ago I set out, on suggestion of a friend, to make a text adventure based on some ideas he had.

She insists it is of the utmost importance that you acquire TICKETS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;I get tickets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You try to get tickets, but you have no idea how do to that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Go on the internet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You open up your laptop, and try to open Google, but it seems the WIRELESS NETWORK is not available. It is located in another room. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Connect by cable for handiness&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You grab an ETHERNET CABLE, and insert it into the PORT on the side of your laptop. The sexual undertones of this action do not escape you. Luckily Christine is entranced by a mysterious light emanating from the BOOKSHELF.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You browse to ALTAVISTA, your favourite search engine, to look for tickets, but you have forgotten the comedian's name. What is his name?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Dylan Moran&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Ah, DYLAN MORAN, how could you have forgotten? Rumours of a ONE-OFF FAREWELL SHOW SOMEWHERE IN THE SOUTH OF ULSTER have been brewing for some time.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;However, searching his name yields little information, but just mounds of mildly repulsive erotic fan fiction. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Read the erotic fan fiction&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;With some misgivings, you browse to MORANLOVE.TK, to read these stories which have buried the search results you really wished to see. What you see is not pleasant. Moran violently sodomises DARA O BRIAIN, and the act causes him to inflate to a GIANT SIZE. This gives you an idea.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Turn off the laptop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Disgusted, you push the laptop away from you and close it, sending it into sleep mode. But not before you forward the story to BENNA, a crazy girl who appears to have an unreal obsession with you handcuffing her. Perhaps this will scare her off.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Leave the room&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You leave the room, leaving Christine behind. You have abandoned your bro, so uncool. You are unsure of where you want to go next. You are in a HALLWAY, downstairs are the LIVING AREA, DINING ROOM, and KITCHEN, and in this section of the house are the PALACE OF WISDOM, your BEDROOM, and the BEDROOMS of other family members.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Go back and get Christine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Then go to the palace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You return to retrieve CHRISTINE, and together you head to the PALACE OF WISDOM. However, it is trashed. It seems you have not cleaned it since your cousins were here last week. As Gilda the Griffon would say, what a bunch of lame-os.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You see your GAMES SYSTEM, and ASSORTED GAMES, including GOD OF WAR, which you have not yet completed. Also visible are your TELEVISION, and BOMB-ASS SOUND SYSTEM, on which you jam your all-time favourite band, TAKING BACK SUNDAY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br clear="all" /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Suddenly, you are informed via Text Message that CHRISTINE has joined your PARTY. You aren't really sure what this means in the long-run.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Leave the house with my party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You want to leave the house, and the nearest exit is the WINDOW to the PALACE of WISDOM. You bust it out open, and fashion some bed sheets into a kind of rope to aid your descent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You have reached your DRIVEWAY; visible are OTHER HOUSES, and a ROAD. You are facing NORTH.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;The road goes WEST-EAST.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Go to Sha's house&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You head out to SHA'S HOUSE, although it has not yet been explained who SHA is, or even where her house is. However, the fearless narrator shall fill in some blanks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You and SHA, which is an affectionate contraction of SHAUNA, her full given name, go back a long time. You both attended the same PRIMARY SCHOOL, where you learned the basic Rs, including WRITING, and RITHMETIC. You don't really care much for reading, unless said book is either the sacred text, THE BRO CODE, or CM PUNK'S GUIDE TO LIVIN STRAIGHT, NO HOMO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;SHA is excitable, and friendly.

You are at the BUS DEPOT, to your left is a SHOPPING CENTRE, in front of you is a smaller SHOPPING CENTRE, and to your right is the TOWN CENTRE, which is the hub of town life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Check missed calls!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Ah, of course, you completely ignored your phone call from earlier. You grab your totally sweet PHONE and go to the call register, to check MISSED CALLS. It turns out it was from your sister, but why would she be calling you at lunchtime on a Saturday? You ask SHA, but she has no clue. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Ring her back&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You type in 7; since this is your SISTER's binding on your SPEED DIAL THING, and awaits an answer. When she picks up, she is as excitable as anyone you have met today. She has some exciting news. It seems popular comedian, DYLAN MORAN, is playing a show soon. She suggests that getting tickets is the thing of the moment, but she, for once, is unsure of how to do that. She leaves it entirely in your hands. You are standing outside the BUS DEPOT, you haven't moved at all during this time. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Go to buy tickets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You set out to buy DYLAN MORAN TICKETS, but it seems that the local TICKET REPOSITORY has shut down, since they hinged all their money on a LIMP BIZKIT concert only lame dudes went to. You'll have to find another way. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Ask around for tickets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You harangue RANDOM STRANGERS for DYLAN MORAN TICKETS, but it seems that these lame dudes are totes out of the loop, and are not aware of the show. In fact, it seems that when you tell them, they instead ask you for tickets. The last person at the bus depot you have not approached, SHADY TRICKSTER STRANGER WHO IS PROBABLY HIGH, leaves before you can ambush him with questions. You are still standing at the BUS DEPOT, ticketless.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Go to the town centre&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You head out for the TOWN CENTRE, a bustling hubbub of economic and social activity. There are two main areas here, the TOWN SQUARE, where one may often see HOBOS, and the MARSHES, where one may often see LISTLESS YOUTH. Where do you go?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Ask hobos for tickets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;The HOBOS seem confused when you ask for TICKETS, but when they learn how valuable they are, they offer to assist you in your quest. FOUR HOBOS have joined your party; CHRISTINE asks them about their TROUBLED CHILDHOODS. You just want TICKETS. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Have the hobos break into the place that sold the tickets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Feeling quite like a CRIMINAL MASTERMIND, you send the HOBOs forth to break into the TICKET REPOSITORY, in the hope that perhaps they had some DYLAN MORAN TICKETS. However, even if they do not, you can still get some TOUTABLE LOOT. The HOBOS break in like dudes jonesing for dark, absurdist humour, they return to you with a DULL BOX, which is shut with sellotape. One of them pulls a knife out of their coat pocket. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;&lt;br clear="all" /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What's a dull box?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You ask the HOBOs what a DULL BOX is, and they simply press the BOX, which is dulled from age, in front of you. The box is clearly labelled January 31st, 2010, a date that seems familiar for some reason. You brush off these petty concerns and try to open the box with your dull FINGERNAILS. Surely there is a better box-opening implement available in the immediate vicinity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Take the knife and open the box with it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You grab the KNIFE, and HOBO MENTAL JIM is shocked by your speed. You cut open the box, and voila, there is a light emanating from it, like this was some shitty Thomas Kinkade painting or something. BOX OF LIGHT. But whatever, is this what you're looking for? Yes it is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;COMMERCIAL BREAK&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Commercial break?!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;The NARRATOR has returned from UNSPECIFIED BUSINESS. But as he had been saying, you have found what you are looking for. What is your next move?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Check how many tickets I have attained&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You rummage through the box of TOUTABLE LOOT. Oh this is quite a haul. You have 6 DYLAN MORAN TICKETS, and also one ticket to AN EVENING WITH ADAM LAZZARA: MC'D BY EDGE. You don't really care what the other stuff is, but you're sure it will get you enough money for something nice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You stand around doing nothing, and your PARTY of SEVEN INCLUDING YOU just stand around, loitering, being a menace to society. You hear a creepy breathing sound in the distance; it seems to be coming from the nearby STREET LIGHT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;RUN FROM THE STREET LIGHT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You run frantically from the STREET LIGHT, discomforted by its aura. Although perplexed, your PARTY has no choice to follow you, except for the HOBOs, you'd much rather sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Where are you running to? asks your PARTY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;To the marshes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;To meet teenagers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You rush to THE MARSHES, the centre of TOWN LIFE, for TEENAGERS anyway. You like to hang out here and waste away the days, lacking any sort of higher calling. Plus the SUBWAY does some mean sandwiches that you just cannot resist. It seems that an old or relatively new friend is there anyway. She is busy being upset about her AMPLE BOSOM. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Compliment the dids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You approach the BUXOM YOUNG FEMALE, and mention that you are wont to compliment her DIDS, given how ample they are.

She also seems mad at you, but it's not like you've done anything recently.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;I ask what I've done&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;THE FUCK DID I DO, you exclaim, but quietly, because you're afraid what might happen if you publicly show contempt for this close friend whose name you have forgotten. Actually, what is her name?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Natalya&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Because of the dids&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;THE FUCK DID I DO, NAT? you ask, knowing that calling her by her full, eastern-sounding name serves only to incite her fury. It seems she is not entirely sure why is she mad at you, which means there must be a really good reason so infuriating she has blocked it from her memory.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Compliment her dids again&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;"You have KILLER DIDS, they're like cushions man!" You aren't sure why you suddenly have such a keen interest in "dids all of a sudden". You have examined your behavioural patterns, and they definitely indicate violent, lustful homosexual monogamy with a HISTORY STUDENT. However, they are pretty good dids, so you roll with it. She blushes; it seems you are embarrassing her in front of her SECRET CRUSH. Natalya has TRUST ISSUES, and a STRONG NEED TO EXPRESS HERSELF CREATIVELY. You don't mind this since she's pretty good with words. She asks what you want to do, since she is kind of bored, and wants to escape from her SECRET CRUSH, before you cause any more embarrassment. You suddenly realise why she mad.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 0.0001pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Leave the Marshes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You leave THE MARSHES, going NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR. You really just want to catch up with your breastacularly endowed friend, Nat. Your PARTY are familiar with her, although CHRISTINE is certainly much fonder of her than SHA. However the PARTY seems to have little independent thought capacity as of now, perhaps you need to unlock this feature by progressing through the current STORY MODE. Where do you go?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Go to the store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You go to THE SPIRIT STORE, a local pub run by ESTEEMED SENATOR MARK DEARY, and some other guy whose name you never cared to learn. It is like 12:25 by the time you get there, and since there is no match on today, banter is scarce. You approach the BAR COUNTER, CLARKSON is working the taps.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Why is it so damn early?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Fuck off to the park instead&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;It's 12? What the fuck bro, you're sure you're never up that early, not unless you're going to a FOREIGN ESTABLISHMENT OF LEARNING for an important, life-changing interview. Even then it's debatable whether you will actually get up on time. Thus your PROPENSITY FOR SLEEPING IN is established. You earn the BEDHEAD character trait. You head to THE PARK, a place where one can find a PLAYGROUND, filled with ENTERTAINMENT OF A LARGE AND PLASTIC NATURE, and a LARGE GREEN EXPANSE. There are also some TREES and a GAZEBO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Hang in the gazebo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You approach the GAZEBO, which would in a civilized town play host to MUSICAL ENTERTAINMENT, but this being the place it is, it is simply a place for PESKY KIDS to loiter. You sit down; NAT does not join your party. It seems it is important that she play a role later that requires her never joining your TOTALLY COOL PARTY OF BROS. It is now time to name your PARTY. This name is unchangeable, so choose wisely.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;The Peepulation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You have named your party THE PEEPULATION. This, of course, is a reference to the popular blog, FUCK THIS SHIT, I HAVE SURFING LESSONS. You think that's the title of it. You're not sure. All you know is that it is mad enjoyable. You sit around doing nothing at THE GAZEBO. Since none of you made a trip to THE OFFY, you can't even get your drink on.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Walk home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You WALK HOME. This is something you have endeavoured to do since you were a YOUNG LAD, FILLED WITH HOPES AND DREAMS. THE PEEPULATION is not so keen on the idea, and NAT doubts your ability to do it. You must roll for stamina. Actually, now would be a good time to apportion your STATS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Give me a minute while I create the stat system, BROFIST&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Looking forward to seeing this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Somehow you have survived HOBOs and THAT CREEPY LAMPOST thus far without apportioning your BROFIST points. You chose BROFIST points last year, when you did your EXAMS OF SCHOOLEND. You chose it over other systems, like FAGGOTS, and WEAKLIN. None of them compared to the elegant simplicity, the beauty, the practicality, the BRONESS, of BROFIST. You have 20 points to apportion, and values go from 0-9.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Broness&lt;br /&gt;Robustness&lt;br /&gt;Originality&lt;br /&gt;Fortitude&lt;br /&gt;Intelligence&lt;br /&gt;Smoothness&lt;br /&gt;Tact&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You cannot apportion points to BRONESS, its value will rise and fall based on your actions in the game. It is a crude sort of morality system if you will. Actions are rated on a scale of RACKJACKER to STINSON, with 9 representing TRUE STINSON, and 0 representing TRUE RACKJACKER.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Hmm...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;I can’t decide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Give me one of the presets&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Hold on, I must explain the remaining stats.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;ROBUSTNESS determines your RAW BRUTE STRENGTH.

You are nobody's MICHAEL BAY, that's for certain.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You apportion 4 to SMOOTHNESS.

You are not in particularly good PHYSICAL SHAPE, although you can run for brief periods if need be. You are also not particularly LUCKY, but you are not so unlucky that CERTAIN VICTORIES can be transformed into DEFEATS.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;By default, your two party members are assigned 3 to ALL FIELDS, and have 2 POINTS left over, to apportion at a later point, when certain skills might be necessary.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Sounds good&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Also by default, you are given a BRO value of 4.5. You are not TOTALLY BRO right now, but you wouldn't go behind your bro's back. That shit just isn't cool. Although you might disregard DIBS for an INSANELY HOT CHICK I MEAN HOW IS SHE SO HOT OH GOD.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;To walk HOME, you would need a FORTITUDE value of 4.

What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;HEY&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;I have never disregarded dibs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Look dude, in the interest of the game, you can't get your actual BRO VALUE of 9 straight away.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;DAMN&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What to do next&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What are my options?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Plus DIBS have not yet been presented.

It is much better than GAMESTOP, which is a bit of an OVERPRICED SHITHOLE. Fuck, it is SO OVERPRICED.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You reach HMV, in front of you are sections dedicated to MUSIC OF VARIOUS GENRES, FILMS BOTH STANDARD, and HIGH-DEFINITION. There are also sections for THE VIDYA, and TELLY. There are also some tables with BOOKS on them, and some HARDWARE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Browse for hours&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You BROWSE FOR HOURS.

Have you made up your mind? ==COMMERCIAL BREAK==&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;I dislike commercial breaks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;During the COMMERCIAL BREAK, you were presented with ADVERTISEMENTS for many DESIRABLE PRODUCTS on which you would like to drop some CA$H DOLLA$. You are sure owning these products will make you TOUGHER, IMPROVED, QUICKER, MORE ROBUST.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Have you decided to drop some CA$H DOLLA$ up in, or will you keep your MONEY for something else.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;There are no CLOUDS in the SKY.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Keep the money&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Go outside the marshes to chill and rate passing poon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You decide that it is not the time for NEW TIMES. You go outside and CHILL WITH THE PEEPULATION, and assign numerical values to FEMALES who walk by. The numerical values assigned are determined primarily by how desirable you find them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;THE PEEPULATION find this SLIGHTLY DISGUSTING, but nonetheless participate.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;What is seen?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;And what is done?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;This isn't as fun without options...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;It's like actually being at the marshes&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;But PLAYER, you must realise, although THE NARRATOR relates the world to you, he can only describe it. You must decide what to do. You have given LITTLE INFORMATION as to the current situation. Which set of benches are you placed upon, for example? IT IS A MYSTERY WRAPPED IN AN ENIGMA WRAPPED IN BAD GAME DESIGN.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Although there are times when you will be given a SET, LIMITED NUMBER OF OPTIONS TO PROCEED, now is not one of those times. THE NARRATOR cannot imagine anything EXCITING or PLOT-ADVANCING happening here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Get me to the plot dammit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You try to advance quickly to the PLOT, throwing caution to the wind and disregarding important PLOT DEVELOPMENTS. You find, while being a misogynist, that your new ART TEACHER, MZ. THAUMA TURGE is walking by. You are reminded of your old art teacher, HERA PRAXITELES, who is not GREEK, despite her name. You remember her being a TOTAL BANG, and there certainly existed between you a sort of SPARK, the kind which, if applied to HOT, NAKED KINDLING, might result in the BURNING FLAME of SEXUAL RELATIONS, and PERHAPS BREAKFAST. However, it seems you did not get any contact information before she left for her new job... SOMEWHERE. Damn your previously mentioned poor memory. You are suddenly consumed with a SINGULAR DESIRE to GET FRESH with this FINE MADAMOISELLE PRAXITELES. Thanks to the internet, there are many ways of finding out where she currently is.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Do you wish to FIND HER ON THE INTERNET, or CONTINUE RATING A COLLECTION CONSISTING OF TOTAL BANGS AND TOTAL MUNTERS?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Compare total bangs and munters to the teacher&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Then find her on the internet&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;It seems THE PEEPULATION is not familiar with MME. PRAXITELES. You feel it imperative to communicate to them just how impressive her physical beauty really is. You take a KIND OF SCARY TEENAGER, with DEMENTED EYES, as a 1, and a CHICK ON A MAGAZINE SOMEONE IS HOLDING, as a 10. You then say that neither compare to her. THE PEEPULATION is SUFFICIENTLY IMPRESSED. SWEET SHIT BRO.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You have a number of ways of accessing the INTERNET. Your PHONE informs you there a number of WIRELESS NETWORKS available. However, they are all PASSWORD PROTECTED, although you have heard rumours of an UNSECURED NETWORK down SUBWAYWAYWAYWAYOHFUCKTHAT. There are also a number of COMPUTER KIOSKS in THE MARSHES. What do you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Check out subway while getting food&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You decide to go up to SUBWAY, to mack on some mad meatball marinaras, or whatever your LUNCHEON OF REPUTE is. You sure are glad you didn't spend money on that JOHN CENA DVD. Had you done so, you would lack SUFFICIENT FUNDS to have FREE REIGN OVER THE SUBWAY MENU. You arrive at the FOOD COURT. There are 4 EATERIES visible. THAT BAGEL PLACE, KFC, BURGER KING, and, of course, SUBWAY. Your phone confirms that SUBWAY FREE WIFI is available. You see TABLES, but as of now, nobody you recognise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Get subway and sit down with my party&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You go to SUBWAY, and sit down at a TABLE with THE PEEPULATION. You successfully connect to the NETWORK, but there is no INTERNET ACCESS. Balls. You figure you can RESOLVE THIS ISSUE, while also acquiring your MIDDAY LUNCHEON. Actually that’s redundant surely lunch can only happen in the middle of the day. The girl at SUBWAY is NICE, BUT NOT REALLY YOUR TYPE. She also looks NERDY, like she runs a GNU/LINUX INSTALLATION, in favour of WINDOWS. You can approach NICE GIRL, or talk to GEORGE HOOK DOPPELGANGER, who is the MANAGER OF THIS FINE ESTABLISHMENT, but probably was born before ALAN TURING AND CO broke THE ENIGMA CODE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Talk to nice girl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You approach the NICE GIRL, and notice she is of ASIAN EXTRACTION, BUT THE HOTTER KIND, LIKE NORTHEAST ASIA, and MAYBE ONE OF THE ISLANDS. You think briefly about RIVERS CUOMO, who would almost definitely be getting his stalk on to this girl. Thankfully, you are nowhere near as creepy. What is your first course of action? Which is more important? Your hunger, or BANGING HOT ART TEACH, that is to say she is BANGING HOT, not that your immediate course of action is banging her. This NICE GIRL on the other hand.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Food is priority&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;"May I take your order?" she says, in a QUIET, UNASSUMING VOICE.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 2.25pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Here, above all else, syntax and word choice are key.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;Nobody wants a disgusting BLAM AND BLURKYsandwich you can't eat.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;I'll go for a chicken and bacon ranch please&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;"&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="MsoNormal" style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; line-height: normal; margin-bottom: 3.75pt;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: #cccccc;"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"&gt;You have failed to specify a BREAD CLASS for your MACKING DELICIOUS SUB.

As books go, it's not great. Jordan repeats himself and whenever a new character is introduced he falls back on one of three or four clichés. But still, despite this, I've read it something like three times, each time in no time at all, it is an easy as hell read. It should be mentioned before I blog this that this is basically, in extremely short form, a retelling of David Foster Wallace's essay, "How Tracey Austin Broke My Heart", which is in &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Consider-Lobster-David-Foster-Wallace/dp/034911952X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1299762442&amp;amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Consider the Lobster&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, &lt;i&gt;An Independent Ma&lt;/i&gt;n is not a great book, and I reckon the reason I've read it so frequently and with such ease and speed is due mainly to the inherent appeal a story about Jordan Grand Prix would have for me. Like I just ate up his account of the team's first seasons in F1 (and I actually learned some useless information about the qualifying set-up back then), his dealings with Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna, and, despite the fact that it was a short passage altogether, the parts dealing with the notorious 2000 season, which was the beginning of the end for the team, which today still exists in a way as Force India. Which leads me to another problem I had with the book, it's length. There is not nearly enough about the most interesting things, like the aforementioned 2000 season. Really I would have no problem with it being split into 3 distinct books, although I doubt this was a viable proposition. Also the book had some cool photos, of Eddie Irvine and such, which it seems many of the books I have read recently are of the sort that contain pertinent photos in the midsection, which probably reflects something or other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, a well-written book charting Jordan Grand Prix's rise and fall could be a fantastic, engaging thing, but it's unlikely to happen; not that the general world of motor sport writing is lacking in talent, but that it would only really have niche appeal, unless maybe it had some world-rocking revelations about Michael Schumacher's life or something. Actually, I'd be really interested in reading a relatively technical biography of Gordon Murray, Adrian Newey, or Rory Byrne, three people who definitely had a far bigger impact on Formula 1 than Eddie Jordan (who certainly was quite influential himself, and, as the years went on and Jordan declined, started to take on a sort of Tyrellian role in the F1 world, sheltering Fisi and nurturing Timo Glock and Nick Heidfeld, along with a bunch of other guys who didn't amount to anything).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might perhaps edit this post at a later point, after another reading of the text in question, to include more observations and commentary. In the meantime, it is worth one's while tracking down Wallace's aforementioned essay, which will communicate the point (which I have spectacularly failed to make) quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All aside, the B&amp;amp;H ads Jordan had were really cool too,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/03/inherent-plot-appeal-versus-quality-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5968116838408062341'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5968116838408062341'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-2432333979130391480</id><published>2011-03-09T00:06:00.005Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.452+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Catching up'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General Interest'/><title type='text'>Gunnin' for that Gold Medal</title><content type='html'>I actually managed to make in to my petrology lab today, despite my weakened physical state. In retrospect, it probably wasn't worth it. It was meant to be a revision lab, but fuck-all got done, but I did get my Paleo lab book back (got a 66, YEAH BITCHES). I also learned about streak plates, which will probably come in very handy in the practical exams themselves.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, there was one wonderful piece of new fact gleamed from this lab. While the demonstrator talked to a group of us about a) the impossibility of getting above an 80 in CA, b) the dearth of dinosaurs in geology, c) how Ross Geller is a shitty geologist, and d) what we planned to specialise in, she told us one amazing thing: In Trinity, if you graduate with an average of 75 or higher (as a general rule. It's 75 in science, but some courses require an 80, medicine requires a 70, and TSMs require you have no grades below 70), you get a freaking gold medal! This is my life goal now. Getting that gold medal. I will get that 75 average, then I will get that gold medal, then I will get ALL THE PLAY, ALL OF IT! Oh and also all the prestige, not that prestige is particularly amenable to quantitative measurement. At first I suspected she was joshing me, but later a quick internet search revealed it to be the truth!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I am doing this, I am making this happen. Unfortunately the time frame is much too long to fit into the whole lent thing (yes I am doing lent in spite of personal beliefs (or lack of them, rather), because it's just a damn good carrot man), so I had to go with some things that are likely to be way more difficult, but I will pull them off. Then, 3 years from now, I will be staring down that gold medal. My new year's resolutions (yes these are also a mad gay concept, but carrots man, carrots) are also coming along pretty well. As a whole I'm pretty content with 2011 so far. My academic work has improved markedly, I'm socializing more, I'm reading and writing more, shit is so good. I still need to get better at playing along with jokes and such, but I can't do everything at once. I'm not Jackie Stewart like.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Delirious Self-Improvementnasty,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/03/gunnin-for-that-gold-medal.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2432333979130391480'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2432333979130391480'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7747985589836384844</id><published>2011-03-08T20:22:00.004Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.475+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Illness'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Non-Sequiturs'/><title type='text'>Flat 7-Up and Chicken Soup</title><content type='html'>Man I am delirious sicknasty, it is just horrible.

There is a correlation between the number of songs featuring Masta Killa on a Wu-Tang Clan album, and it's quality. I knew it!&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In fact, I ran a regression too, and man the correlation up in is mad significant. Most interestingly, a Wu-Tang album with no Masta Killa verses would actually rate off the scale, scoring an average of between 11 and 12. The average Wu-Tang album also loses an average of just over one point per Masta Killa song. And the correlation, as mentioned before, is mad significant, with an R value of 0.99, where 1 is the maximum.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A note on the ratings: They aren't absolute, but rather done in the Ebert fashion. If I judge each album as a piece of work by the Wu-Tang, what would I give it out of ten, with 36 Chambers representing a 10 and the general presence of Cappadonna representing a 0 (originally I was going to run this with Cappadonna appearances, since, unlike Masta Killa, Cappadonna isn't a good rapper, but since he disassociated from the Wu around after &lt;i&gt;The W&lt;/i&gt;, it wasn't going to fly). It's also worth mentioning that I don't think Masta Killa is bad. His debut solo album, &lt;i&gt;No Said Date&lt;/i&gt;, is one of the best Wu solo efforts of 2000-2004. It's simply an unfortunate yet interesting correlation, between my personal opinion of a Wu album, and the amount of Masta Killa up ins. The decline in quality could also be attributed to the RZA's increasing loopiness, and also that after his five-year plan was over, the group didn't really seem to have the unified direction it had in the early days, when it was dominating everything with great solo albums. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As I've mentioned before, this reflects unfairly on Masta Killa, but I thought it was worth a blog. As atonement for this fronting, I'll encourage you again to get his solo albums. That's all I can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;DELIRIOUS STATSNASTY,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/03/investigation-into-effect-abundance-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2207890927721582282'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2207890927721582282'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-e0qkBxC7YMY/TXaINow1QfI/AAAAAAAAAGk/TIhpIjsMqyY/s72-c/Untitled.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-4192003387653849885</id><published>2011-03-07T23:02:00.015Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.460+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Non-Sequiturs'/><title type='text'>A post wherein reaction images are used to convey the duality of my social life (images from Dresden Codak, by Aaron Diaz)</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3cmzrgj_clY/TXVkJfqK8RI/AAAAAAAAAGU/Nb6q78KI3lA/s1600/What%2Bit%2Bbe%2B2.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 133px; height: 144px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3cmzrgj_clY/TXVkJfqK8RI/AAAAAAAAAGU/Nb6q78KI3lA/s320/What%2Bit%2Bbe%2B2.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5581477427475575058" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;This is Ground State Cathal at a party.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DxLaM3Rrm6I/TXVkBSDS0wI/AAAAAAAAAGM/nj_OMmI6s5I/s1600/What%2Bit%2Bbe%2B1.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 220px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DxLaM3Rrm6I/TXVkBSDS0wI/AAAAAAAAAGM/nj_OMmI6s5I/s320/What%2Bit%2Bbe%2B1.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5581477286383899394" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;del&gt;This is Cathal socializing at a party while intoxicated, or not anxious.&lt;/del&gt; This is Excited State Cathal. However, unlike the young lady in this image, I do not like coffee, and have never really been in a situation where "wanna get coffee" has been an option on the dialogue tree.

I'm not huge on tea either.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Pretty much my main problem is I will pick up on some minor interest a person has that I am hugely into and I will seem way too into it, like I have a shrine to Robert Pollard in my closet or something. Well I mean technically all those cheap beer cans that are going to be in the kitchen tomorrow are a shrine of sorts, so they're half right, but it's not like I'm the one drinking all that Wackenburg (SICK BURN). I should probably ease up on that, since I'd be a fool to think anyone is seriously into American presidents or rap music or bread all that much. Those aren't the kind of people that party. Well maybe the rap dudes do, but like in faded Wu-wear and at battle venues or something. I don't have the requisite Wu-wear to party with those dudes, so I can't party with them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Cool fact in need of citation: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was once bored, so he wrote to five of his friends, "We have been discovered, flee immediately".

That sucks, I mean the only times I've ever visited the XXL site have been to read his blogs, where he talks about actual rap music, as opposed to blog posts on his own personal site, where he posts noods and Alex Jones stuff. I've actually bought 3 issues of XXL in my life, one out of boredom, and two for the "Making of" section they had, back when The Blueprint was literally the only album I listened to. But XXL finally fired him. It was probably started by &lt;a href="http://iamnotarapperispit.com/2011/02/banned-byron-crawfords-xxl-article-on-odd-future-uncensored/"&gt;that Odd Future post&lt;/a&gt;, in which he compared Odd Future to juggaloes, and Odd Future fans threw a shitfit. It was entertaining. Not that I don't like Odd Future, I mean they're good, but some of the overblown rhetoric of fans over here is hilarious. Odd Future are good though, I mean it takes serious skill to sound good over a second-rate Gucci Mane beat. But the hubbub over the article was just even better than usual. Also in the video of their Fallon performance, Jimmy Fallon looks an awful lot like Jimmy Smits. Who was in a dream I had recently. Yeah. In the dream, I complemented his work on Outlaws, a show I have no intention of ever watching. I'm guessing I mentioned it because even dream me has pretty much no knowledge of his work.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'll miss the extra visibility a blogging gig at XXL afforded Crawford though. It led to so much hilarious butthurt over the years, and all the resultant dears were delicious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the point of this post is how XXL have pretty much lost a customer, even though I've never been in their target market in the first place (not being a fan of shit generally). My life as a consumer has been reduced to being in a variety of periphery demographics, doomed forever to be ignored by market researches and be subjected to cut-rate off-model products by feckless license-holders. I think the only target market I'm actually a part of is the "Students" demographic for buying pizza. I'm a big fan of pizza. I'm actually getting some today. It feels nice to be catered to. It's much nicer than the rage I feel every time Equestria Daily posts pictures of the latest off-model palette swap shit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mean, damn, they would make a mint from dudes like me who will drop money on on-model Rainbow Dash figures. Apparently they don't even have plans for a Friendship is Magic DVD, even though some of the G1 shit from the '80s is available. I really don't get Hasbro. I get their TV channel, The Hub though. The Hub just doesn't understand that it's easy for syndicated programs to air in running order. The only thing we've lost from this is the original magical-girl concept of FiM that Lauren Faust had, but that might be a good thing, given a) we got a great completely different show out of it, and b) it's still possible there'll be a Milky Way and the Galaxy Girls show or something, after she leaves FiM or it ends or whatever. Which will be at least a couple of years away, since the guy who voices Big Macintosh is in the booth recording lines for (we're assuming) season 3. But it might happen eventually, which would be sweet. Also, tomorrow I am gonna mack on some pancakes.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have finally managed to make a post about both My Little Pony and rap music, thus isolating absolutely everyone who might ever read this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Delirious Lentnasty,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/03/periphery-demographic.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5310241906567861819'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5310241906567861819'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-4388376884073267007</id><published>2011-03-02T12:57:00.003Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.462+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lists'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>20 years of good rap music</title><content type='html'>A couple of years ago, on the &lt;a href="www.avclub.com"&gt;A.V. Club&lt;/a&gt; I found out about a list making exercise, wherein your favourite album from each year of your life was chosen and listed. I did, and I think I lost it when I deleted my bebo profile, which seems like such a long time ago, but since everytime I blog about music Danish dudes seem to jump on it, I'm gonna get back to one of my favourite subjects-nobody-gives-a-shit-about: rap music. So yeah, my favourite hip-hop album for each year from 1991-2010, this should be fun.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1991) De La Soul - De La Soul is Dead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wow, this list is off to an excellent start. I'm not sure what the De La Soul fanbase at large thinks of this, but personally I prefer it to 3 Feet High and Rising, which actually made a list of Best Indie Rock Albums a couple of years back. This one has so many killer jams, like Fanatics of the B Word and A Roller Skating Jam Named Saturdays, and it has limited verses from The Two Guys Who Aren't Posdnous (one of them still manages to shit up A Roller Skating Jam, "Mr. Sprinkler, Mr. Sprinkler" I mean come the fuck on), it's I think maybe their best album, and it's got Prince Paul's best production work ever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1992) Pete Rock &amp;amp; CL Smooth - Mecca &amp;amp; The Soul Brother&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fuck yes Pete Rock. This also has T.R.O.Y., the saddest song to ever be written. It's a shame these dudes didn't make more albums, it was just fantastic to listen to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1993) Wu-Tang Clan - Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh yes! Aside from The RZA's bizarre pronouncements and the general existence of Masta Killa, the Wu-Tang are one of the best oversized groups ever, up there with Arcade Fire and Plastic Ono Band. This one is also great because it only has one Masta Killa verse. There might be a relation between the quality of a Wu album and the abundance of Masta Killa. I must investigate.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1994) Nas - Illmatic&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nas is like Weezer. Nas is exactly like Weezer. But that's for another blog post, and there's been enough already written about how perfect &lt;i&gt;Illmatic&lt;/i&gt; is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1995) GZA/Genius - Liquid Swords&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1995 actually looks to be pretty thin, and there was only non-Wu album this year that I really liked. But yeah, 1995 was the peak for the Wu-Tang Clan, this and &lt;i&gt;Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...&lt;/i&gt;, they've fallen so far.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1996) Ghostface Killah - Ironman&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This one has Daytona 500, which is maybe the catchiest song ever written. This is like 3 Wu albums in 4 years, I do love enforcing stereotypes, but this one is great. It's a shame Ghostface never got significant pop success, it'd be great. He also should have played Iron Man in the film, that would have been interesting.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1997) Company Flow - Funcrusher Plus&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is one of my top 5 albums ever. Fuck it is SO GUD. This was the album that put Rawkus on the map too, and I mean you decide whether that was a net gain for the world. The lyrics are mind-blowing, the flows are intricate and transcendant, and the beats have a harsh minimalism that evokes a rainy day in a grey city, long since resigned to its loss of influence as the manufacturing base moves ever eastward. If there was one album on this list I'd recommend above all others, it would be this one, it is simply fucking amazing. They never got around to releasing a second album, which sucks, since all the tracks they did after &lt;i&gt;Funcrusher Plus&lt;/i&gt;, like Patriotism and Linda Tripp and D.P.A., all were even better than this album. As a result of all the label trouble that resulted in no second album though, we got Definitive Jux, so I mean everything worked out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1998) Outkast - Aquemini&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This isn't actually my favourite OutKast album, that honour goes to&lt;i&gt; Stankonia&lt;/i&gt;, but this one is still fantastic. Apparently they're working on a new album, which is awesome, since I fucking loved Big Boi's solo effort. Incidentally, this was another year low on Rap Albums I Liked. Although&lt;i&gt; Aquemini&lt;/i&gt; would be in the running any year, it was the only one this year I liked, since I was never huge on &lt;i&gt;Miseducation of Lauryn Hill&lt;/i&gt;. Unplugged was way fucking better.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1999) Mos Def - Black on Both Sides&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This one narrowly edges out &lt;i&gt;The Slim Shady LP&lt;/i&gt;, mainly on the basis of Mathematics, one of the mind-blowing raps ever set to tape.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2000) Eminem - Marshall Mathers LP&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Remember when Eminem was fresh and exciting and brilliant? Me too. What fun times they were. &lt;i&gt;Supreme Clientele &lt;/i&gt;also came out this year, bringing the Wu back in a big way. Ghostface is always great. Always. 2000 was actually a great year. MMLP, Supreme Clientele, Deltron 3030, Stankonia. And Def Jux was founded. Holy shit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2001) Cannibal Ox - The Cold Vein&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And the reign of Def Jux begins. For the first half of the 00s everything they put out was fantastic. This one is maybe the best, and certainly the best this year, since everyone knows &lt;i&gt;The Blueprint&lt;/i&gt; is the &lt;i&gt;No Jacket Required &lt;/i&gt;of rap music. El-P's beats are radically different from the ones on &lt;i&gt;Funcrusher&lt;/i&gt;, but they remind me of some particularly good ambient music from the late 70s, like Brian Eno pre-&lt;i&gt;Music for Airports&lt;/i&gt; and all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2002) El-P - Fantastic Damage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again his beats are hugely different from the ones on &lt;i&gt;The Cold Vein&lt;/i&gt;, and they're a lot funkier. This also has some of the best rapping I've ever heard, on &lt;i&gt;Deep Space 9MM &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Truancy.&lt;/i&gt; Unbelievably brilliant. He is one of the greats.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2003) Dizzee Rascal - Boy in da Corner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He's the representative of colossal british pop now, but this album has nothing in common with Bonkers or that song he did with yer one Florence. Brand New Day has to be one of the best hope-springs-eternal songs ever, like it's I Shall Be Released tier.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2004) Madvillain - Madvillainy&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first Stones Throw album on the list. If you watch any Adult Swim shows or The Boondocks you might already know them, since pretty much all the bumper music is from their releases. This one has MF Doom rapping over Madlib beats, and even though the songs are all like Guided by Voices-length, it kills, it kills a million times.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2005) Cage - Hell's Winter&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It has beats from El-P and RJD2! It has that guy from Glassjaw! It has Jello Biafra impersonating George W. Bush! Probably the one truly great "emo rap" album ever released, I was never big on Kid Cudi or Charles Hamilton or them. I've heard good things about Donald Glover though, so I'll check him out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2006) J Dilla - Donuts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eh it's hard to describe this one, which was the last album released before J Dilla's death. It's kind of like a trippy Girl Talk album, which shorter tracks maybe. It's definitely an experience.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2007) El-P - I'll Sleep When You're Dead&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Probably the most guest spots out of any album on this list, but usually the spots are only like 10 seconds long, and included solely because it's like Trent Reznor or Cat Power. Insanely fucking good, but again completely different from the 3 other El-P albums on this list. Recommended.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2008) Cadence Weapon - Afterparty Babies&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first canadian! This one had Bob Dylan references, and I actually first listened to it because of the combined recommendations of Carpo and John Meagher. It's really good, but also not like anything else on this list. But definitely worth a listen, especially for people (read: everyone who reads this) who don't really like rap music at all.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2009) P.O.S. - Never Better&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The most "rock" of any entry here, and also the first appearance of a Rhymesayers album. It's got some great tracks, and apparently one of the videos is really fucked up (I haven't watched any of them, and in fact the last music video I saw was the one for Forever, which was HAR HAR forever ago). Yeah. Excellent. Apparently the P.O.S. stands for Pieces of Samantha or Promise of Skill or something, as well as what you think it stands for.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2010) Das Racist - Sit Down, Man&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;See my 2010 in Music post for this one, wrote about there at some length.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well that raps (HO HO THE PUNS KEEP COMING) it up, the list didn't really throw any surprises at me, since there weren't any years when like UGK was the winner by default or something. Oh well.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[HIP-HOP EUPHEMISM],&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/03/20-years-of-good-rap-music.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4388376884073267007'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4388376884073267007'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-8649816841065761155</id><published>2011-02-26T22:36:00.004Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.478+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lists'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>A milestone is reached, and I compose odes in tribute to my close friends</title><content type='html'>100 posts! Who would have thought, back when I started this blog so I could show my friend a short story I wrote (I was unaware of these "google docs" or "filehosting" you speak of), that it would reach 100 posts in just under 2 years. And that it would have up to 5 readers! Originally, back when I was doing a post every 2 days, I planned for my 100th post (which, iirc, was scheduled to fall in late October/November) was to write a paean to my top bros! The make-up of this elite group has changed slightly since this post was first planned in early August, but the general theme, that of a virtual fist-bump for my dudes for being so cool, remains.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And so, in no particular order, the dudes in question, and the mad props they are to receive.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;LARNEY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I live with this guy, he is SO GOOD (nullus, I mean so cool, but me saying It's so good is like a thing). I can't exactly remember when I met him, I assume it was one of those times back when Fitzy went out places, but he's always been the soundest of dudes. Plus an Adventure Time fan, I mean COME ON. Eh yeah generally he is pretty cool, you could even say THE COOLEST. I also think I owe him a pizza or something, I'm not sure.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;FRANK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eh out of all my friends Frank is the guy who wins the award for "Actually the worst person", but in spite of that, he's still a TOP BRO. We talk for hours about silly shit man, and he puts up with it even though I get the sense he has no interest in me talking about whatever. &lt;a href="http://www.skankrandy.blogspot.com/"&gt;He blogs&lt;/a&gt;, and his blog is pretty much how I keep abreast (no hetero) of what is going in wrestling. Basically I plan to know enough so that I can follow the next Wrestlemania, which has The Rock, and me and Frank are gonna chill with Fitzy and enjoy this amazing comeback. Actually, speaking of&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;FITZY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The most antisocial of this loosely-defined bunch, seeing this guy out socializing in Dundalk is an event warranting several phonecalls to people informing them that "Fitzy is here man [What the fuck?]". He's also a master troll, I mean he takes them out at the knees, and makes the potty run out of the body, he amazes. I used to play TF2 with him, back before Valve shat it up with hats and trades and the "Mann-conomy", now we mostly just talk about whatever single-player games we've been playing. A++++. Like many peeps on this list, he &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/rusticskyscraper.blogspot.com"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, so CHECK CHECK IT.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;FORTENGARD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again, not entirely sure how I met this guy, but he's pretty fucking cool. Also a huge animu fan, responsible for introducing me to all kinds of awesome shit, most recently Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt, Steven Stover, and Tony Jaa. He also &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/fortengardcustom.blogspot.com"&gt;blogs&lt;/a&gt;, about a variety of subjects, so you should check it out. He's pretty hysterical too, and our collective hating on Activision is a sight to behold, with so much concentrated haterwatts to boost 100s of flagging rap careers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;DARVER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Again not entirely sure how I first became friends with this guy. All I know is back when I met him he was a massive fan of Whedon and Battlestar. He still is, but I think he's outgrown his Battlestar t-shirt. Also the only Newcastle fan I know, which is bizarre since Newcastle were tearing up the joint when me and my friends were all kids. They had Ferdinand and Shearer up front, and a supporting cast consisting of insane biznasty like Faustino Asprilla and Pavel Srnicek. But yeah, he still keeps me up on TV shows I otherwise wouldn't hear of, and is good craic in a multitude of situations too. Again, he keeps a &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.playwert.blogspot.com"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;, so check that shit up.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;RI&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The closest thing to a shipper on board I know. Kind of a nerd. Also the only person I've talked to one the phone socially in the last 3 years, but that was mostly because she was bored, not because I'm an exceptional conversationalist. The second Whedon superfan on the list, she's a pretty big Nathan Fillion fan, and also a huge Star Wars fan, which is all cool. Also the person on the list I see least, which sucks, because as mentioned before, she's pretty cool. Also there's a girl on this list. My Ace Hen: a progressive blog.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;MULLY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The guy who taught me how to download. Also the person from whom I obtained the seeds for my Dylan archive. 'nuff said.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;KERRIE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another chick, HOW CAN I HANDLE ALL THIS EQUALITY? Kerrie's the one on this list that I've known for the shortest time, but she is pretty cool,&lt;a href="http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/review-of-my-first-semester-in-my.html"&gt; busta game or no busta game&lt;/a&gt;. She's already gotten her own post somehow, so I don't think more words are needed on the topic of her coolness. I've already extolled her coolness in a relatively long post. Read that instead. Or, better yet, watch some Firefly, damn that show is insane.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;EIMEAR&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I browsed my Facebook friendlist for people who warranted comment in this blog post, and she was the last name of note. She's pretty rad, like everyone else on this list (also she's female. You KNOFW i LOVE the BIG EQUALITY), but also the smallest, which I used to kind of take the piss about, but she was all haters gonna hate. She's also like MAD artistic. I was gonna do a blog about her art and shit way back last summer, but it never happened. It might at some point though, but I doubt it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's about it, I might edit this post more after it's publication to include even more dudes, but right now these dudes have certainly earned the mention.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BIG UP,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/02/milestone-is-reached-and-i-compose-odes.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8649816841065761155'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8649816841065761155'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-3868545847110608539</id><published>2011-02-23T14:30:00.020Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.458+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Politics'/><title type='text'>I'm surrounded by idiots, or, a "fisking" of sorts of recent comments made in favour of a "local" politician</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I haven't really blogged about the general election at all yet. Actually, outside of voicing my disgust for The Carpetbagger's candidacy, I may not have mentioned it at all. It's happening this friday actually, and since I have fridays off I can exercise my democratic right nice and early and vote for anyone but Bailiff Adams. Feels futile though, man, since the &lt;a href="http://www.politics.ie/elections/153599-louth-poll-fine-gael-41-sinn-fein-22-fianna-fail-14-labour-13-gp-4-a.html"&gt;latest poll&lt;/a&gt; is just a downright depressing sight. O'Dowd, or alternately, The Guy Who's Not Fucking Terrible and Actually From the County, has lost 3 points, while The Guy Who Actually Knows Nothing About the Economy or Even Basic Welfare Numbers and He Doesn't Even Feel Bad About This Christ How Ignorant Can You Be has somehow gained 5. Fitzpatrick is also likely to get elected, which saves Fine Gael some serious embarrassment.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the reason for this blog is the upward trend in blind stupidity detected in the Louth area over since the start of the cycle. The Bailiff somehow represents a 'change' and a 'better way of doing things', which for people with working brains, is a somewhat bizarre assertion. The only positive represented by The Bailiff running in Louth, an area with which he has no tangible connection outside of some dead bodies (but who cares about those, right?), is that since The Bailiff has no connection to the area, hopefully he can represent a new trend in TDs who win based on being celebrities, rather than through use of (to borrow an American term, and apply it loosely) the pork barrel. Don Givens in 2016!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The stupidity itself though. At first I hoped that the campaign for The Bailiff in Louth would in many ways resemble the Alan Keyes 2004 Senatorial campaign. A famous idiot is drafted into a constituency to which he has no relation, and proceeds to shit himself silly with stupidity and ignorance. Although he did the latter, nobody seemed to really care, since we were apparently blinded by stupidity and simplistic appalling rhetoric (dear God, the "dead patriots" during the debate, yes I fucking raged).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Let us not get into the reprehensible actions of The Bailiff himself, and all the murders and intimidation and voter fraud, and also the actions of Sinn Féin lackeys lately, &lt;a href="http://www.argus.ie/premium/news/memorial-to-ira-hunger-striker-hughes-smashed-2543448.html"&gt;trashing a memorial for a hunger striker&lt;/a&gt; (it's Cooley, specifically, the Long Woman's Grave, which is out of the way even for here, so it's not a mystery as to the allegiance of the culprits) who had the gall to comment on the career of The Bailiff himself, but like what would he know, right?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But onto people my age, who have stirred within me feelings of disappointment on a scale not seen since Teddy Roosevelt watched the Taft presidency unfold. A sizable number of SF voters could abandon The Bailiff (like he abandoned his constituents in West Belfast) and thanks to these blithering idiots he'd still get in. Let us have a look at some things that are being said by the youth in favour of the The Baron's candidacy. Then there will be some reaction images, since only so much can be said about idiocy of this magnitude. Actually fisking these is pointless, there's not even enough incorrect substance to fisk. I didn't even have to go looking for them, they were basically thrown in my face, providing me with some rage fuel from a little closer to home (you should always buy Irish, kids).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;"[The Bailiff] is what this country needs... he is a way better leader than [the other party leaders]"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-63RD0KVszZc/TWUi9F3N1FI/AAAAAAAAAFc/cWhulCZ85e0/s1600/No.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-63RD0KVszZc/TWUi9F3N1FI/AAAAAAAAAFc/cWhulCZ85e0/s320/No.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576902146509362258" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 250px; height: 243px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;"[I'm voting for The Bailiff] because he lives down the road, and round here we stick together." &lt;/i&gt;(This one might not be exactly verbatim, since I can't access my chat logs, but the basic point was Adams was getting the vote because he was "local")&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DPyUq8QibG4/TWU80xRAJdI/AAAAAAAAAF0/c4ANVXvyd0I/s1600/1294269077275.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 234px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DPyUq8QibG4/TWU80xRAJdI/AAAAAAAAAF0/c4ANVXvyd0I/s320/1294269077275.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5576930590843741650" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And perhaps my favourite, a veritable shitstorm of "wat", a response given to the question of "Why [are you voting for The Bailiff]?":&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 16px; "&gt;Because Fianna Failand (sic) Fianna (sic) Gay (sic) are Liars.

But he has a point: the Irish government is bad. Sinn Féin have the TDs to prove it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;From the thing about the drivers (there's actually a pretty good reason for that), and the intimation that politicians have too much time off (between the whole ferrying yourself back and forth from the legislature to your constituency, and all the actual legislating itself, which is, by all accounts, insanely intensive work, and then, in addition, there's all the pork you have to pass out, you have to make sure all those potholes get filled, politicians actually have to work pretty hard just to stay on top of things, they deserve all that time off), to the "Economy trumps environment", which when you're a country such as Ireland, where a large part of the economy &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; the environment (from tourism and agriculture, and then the industrial sector, which Ireland does so well because of the abundance of water resulting from its climate. It turns out industry is quite water intensive, and we have a lot, while Britain has none, hooray), the whole thing is a shitstorm of party-line ignorance. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, perhaps the crowning moment in this horrible diatribe is the accusation levelled against those who are, for reasonable reasons indeed, opposed to, and completely horrified by, the presence of The Bailiff and Sinn Féin in government: That those of this persuasion (of which I am a particularly fervent member) are simply of this completely-stupid-Sinn-Féin-is-like-obviously-the-greatest-ever mindset because their no-good parents have brainwashed them. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Apparently our eyes are closed, and if only we open them we will be confronted with the infinite wisdom of Sinn Féin, a party with policies written by people who are like totally smarter than Elihu Root, John Maynard Keynes and Norman Borlaug put together (That is sarcasm: the Sinn Féin platform is actually written by people whose intelligence combined equals that of J. Danforth Quayle). But this argument is absolutely hilarious, absolutely every part of it; the blanket generalization of all anti-SF peoples (although he has a point, Helen McKendry's deep antipathy towards Sinn Féin is a result of her mother), and the accusation that they are sheep, coupled with his own regurgitation of nonsensical talking points straight off the party platform and some empty noise about 'change', which history buffs will know that Sinn Féin, a party driven by republican sentiment and history more than political ideology, is in fact business as usual round these parts (it's the whole point of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of course this is Ireland. While I expect people to be take an interest in politics as an abstract concept (government spending is wasteful! government should increase spending! SOVEREIGNTY!!!!!!!), it's also a given that they will, as a rule, bask in their ignorance about things like economic policy (it is very easy to make a reasonable argument for "the Fianna Fáil economic policies and austerity measures are breathtakingly stupid, and could well cripple the country for a long while" but I have not heard that argument made by the public at large) or the intricacies of the workings of government itself (the abolition of something as cheap as the Seanad has gained serious weight, because like €27,000,000 is like LOADS of money, we could get rid of it and like buy Leeds United to rouse the national spirit; let's not even touch on the hysterical "IMF IZ TAKEN UR SOVRENTEE" bullshit). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh well, I'm not even sure why I've undertaken this post, since it is completely pointless to talk about Sinn Féin, a party that, from anecdotal evidence, only has one rational, intelligent voter (Cass, in case you're wondering). I guess, as cliche as it sounds, I believe that you should never forget (in this case, SF are different from Fine Gael and Fianna Fail since the latter 2 parties are no longer headed up by the "armies" (read: terrorists and murderers) from whence they came. Sinn Féin are oh are they ever still headed up by these people, and between you and me, I don't take murder and terrorism lightly, nor do I believe it to be "cool" or "better than politics").&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But yeah, it wouldn't hurt to just read or inform yourself a bit, you might actually learn something about government, like how it works, and how it can be stopped.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also The Bailiff has a fucking terrible beard man, may as well be a moustache,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/02/im-surrounded-by-idiots-or-fisking-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3868545847110608539'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3868545847110608539'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-63RD0KVszZc/TWUi9F3N1FI/AAAAAAAAAFc/cWhulCZ85e0/s72-c/No.png' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-1580622726621656659</id><published>2011-02-19T23:02:00.008Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:39.448+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='General Interest'/><title type='text'>Touching on a number of things, all of which interest me</title><content type='html'>David Norris is being interviewed on television right now, talking about being president (apparently the pretext for the interview is his weight loss or something, but nah), and damn he's just so articulate. It remains to be seen whether or not he will get sufficient council backing to actually run, but if he does, it's safe to say that only Fergus Finlay could challenge him for my vote. Gerry Adams certainly won't be getting it, the carpetbagging fuck. That's what's going on right now on the political front, I mean there's the general election upcoming, but what is there to say about that other than laugh at the attempts at internet campaigning by the major parties. But a &lt;a href="http://www.independent.ie/national-news/norris-tops-president-poll-2490541.html"&gt;recent poll&lt;/a&gt; shows Norris with 27% support, double the second place candidate (admittedly there's quite a bit of party overlap in the candidates they selected, &lt;a href="http://nathan-lee.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/I_AM_CAPTAIN_PLANET_by_lastscionz.png"&gt;but with their candidates combined&lt;/a&gt;, he's still 5% ahead of the leading party, which huzzah, a Norris presidency, and all the embarrassments it presents for the Order of Hibernia and republicans everywhere).&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But other things, yes. I have spent this evening reading &lt;a href="http://www.dresdencodak.com/"&gt;Dresden Codak&lt;/a&gt;, a webcomic by Aaron Diaz that is, generally, about a young lady named Kimiko Ross. It's quite an excellent read, with some astonishing art, so check it out. The comics flashing back to Kimiko's childhood are my favourites so far, well-written precocious children are always a joy to read. It reminds me of me, before I turned into an obnoxious jerk when I went to secondary school. Damn dem some shitty times I had there. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Going from a school with less than 100 pupils, where you knew absolutely everyone since small times, to a secondary school, with over 700 pupils, where you don't really know the teachers, and there are enough people for there to be well-established cliques, rather than an amiable pyramid of cool, where the entire class of a dozen or so (my own class was a baker's dozen) are all on decent terms. I wasn't really able to deal with it, and I pretty much had no friends for my entire first year there, that sucked pretty hard. Eventually I became just flat out antisocial, whereas when I was like a small kid I was just really outgoing and talking to everyone. Eventually I ended up getting treatment for social anxiety, and it worked out quite well, and I was able to go to public places by myself again.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But away from that, which wow that was all a jump-off from a comic, and back to something that is also tangentially related to Dresden Codak, the singularity! I was in the library yesterday, on a rare incursion into Dundalk to get a new cellphone, and I ended up reading a Time article about Ray Kurzweil, where I learned he takes something like 200 pills a day in a bid to keep him around for the singularity, so he can transfer his consciousness to a machine. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have to be honest, I'll jump at the chance to do such a thing, it would presents me with opportunities that I really can't even conceive of, like they're on a 11th-dimension level of inconceivable, and then when it finally happens we'll wonder how we couldn't conceive of something so obvious (I'm not up with the latest M-theory developments, so maybe they already have defined the 11th dimension, which would be really cool). There are implications in the singularity too though, like using sentient machines for the whole war thing, but &lt;a href="http://www.dailytech.com/New%20Navyfunded%20Report%20Warns%20of%20War%20Robots%20Going%20Terminator/article14298.htm"&gt;the U.S. Navy got this yo&lt;/a&gt;, which is excellent. That kind of foresight is radical (in the teenager sense, rather than the actual sense), and it reminds me of the reasoning for the Zeroth Law and (spoiler alert) Galaxia in Foundation and Earth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To get back to the present day however, it's All-Star Weekend in the NBA, which has already produced one amazing &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOxq-G-DYNY"&gt;BLAKE GRIFFIN MOMENT™&lt;/a&gt;, which holy hell how awesome is Blake Griffin. The Clippers used to be a joke, but now they're as exciting as the Thunder. Just searching Blake Griffin on youtube &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGeuXnCHyK8"&gt;yields&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XszRzP2K0ek"&gt;megafonzies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE8d35l_YXM"&gt;worth&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBpK7kEk44Y&amp;amp;feature=channel"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdSeL9N2Yrs&amp;amp;feature=channel"&gt;awe-inspiring&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uiQEd-4ko0&amp;amp;feature=channel"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; (note to NBA announcers, facial has another meaning that you should think about it before you use it), this guy is it. GQ actually has a bunch of short articles (and a long one by &lt;a href="http://www.blogger.com/freedarko.blogspot.com"&gt;Bethlehem Shoals&lt;/a&gt; about the OKC Thunder) about why the NBA is so great right now, and it really is. The current young players are so exciting, and the veterans are staying on top of their game longer (can you believe Kobe has been around since the mid-'90s? He's 32!), and if they market it right internationally, you could have a level of interest not seen since the Jordan heyday, when almost everyone in my primary school class could name the Chicago Bulls starting line-up. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, to finish up, there's &lt;a href="http://homestuck.bandcamp.com/album/strife"&gt;a new Homestuck album&lt;/a&gt; out, by Tensei, this one being tracks made for Strife! animations that never were, and it has some absolutely kick-ass art of Bro vs. Jack Noir, which Bro is the best guardian, Dad, Mom, and Seahorse Dad are high-tier when compared to him. I have managed to fulfil the promise contained within this post title, which touches on a number of things I find interesting, so this post is a success. I've done a survey about the lunch choices of TCD students too, so if I get anything interesting out of the collected data I'll blog about that soon, which maybe at least one person might be curious enough to slog through it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I WILL DO SCIENCE TO THE DATA,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/02/touching-on-number-of-things-all-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1580622726621656659'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1580622726621656659'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-509436695819789694</id><published>2011-02-16T13:23:00.004Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.287+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Obituary'/><title type='text'>So long, soldier</title><content type='html'>It is a sad day, a tragic day. My phone is broken.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I cannot enjoy the song of birds, or the morning sun. My phone is broken.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I find no joy in the sound of music, or the laughter of children. My phone is broken.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the sky I see only clouds, in my mind I see no smiles. My phone is broken.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yeah, it finally happened. I've had my cellphone, a Nokia 3410, for 10 years now. It was my first and only phone. I got it the summer before I went to start secondary school, and it's been with me ever since. Other people abandoned it for flashier models with colour screens and cameras, but I stayed true. It was a perfect meeting of form and function, beautifully designed, and easily usable. It was simple and unbloated, it made calls, it sent texts, and it had the perfect alarm, which I have to date never slept through. I might try and fix it actually, just for the alarm. It's been a part of my identity for years, and I'm genuinely sad now it's gone. It may seem odd to be saddened by the loss of a phone, but 10 years is a long time. It's been there through everything. So many life-changing calls and texts were made and received on that phone, so many games of Snake II and Bumper played. The 3410 was always there, never faltering. Oh what a fool I was to put it on the charger that fateful day of February 15th 2011. It's survived longer drops, but now the display is blank. Thankfully I can still make calls, so I can still get home on Thursday, but it's still a sad day, a day of mourning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Over the weekend I'll have to get a new one, and I'm so far out of the phone game I don't even know what to look for. Those HTC Android phones look nice and cool, but the price is a bit steep, and (don't laugh) I'm kind of worried that a phone that sleek and narrow will fall out of my pocket really easily. But I might look at those smartphones, they do look pretty cool. I was saving up to build a new computer over the summer or maybe get a HTC Desire, which I do have enough money to get one now, but that puts the computer plans down the crapper. Damn this choice. Ultimately I'm gonna pluck for a mad cheap phone though, because even a top of the line phone couldn't match the 3410's beauty.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'll try and find a camera to post a touching photo up here. Oh it will be missed.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Nokia 3410, 2002-2011,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The best phone that ever was.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A sad day,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/02/so-long-soldier.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/509436695819789694'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/509436695819789694'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-4836158774494963598</id><published>2011-02-15T23:07:00.006Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.286+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='The Rock'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='nostalgia'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sports'/><title type='text'>The Rock is cooking something, and I am able to smell it</title><content type='html'>Oh shit I did not see this one coming. Dudes who know me know that I think The Rock is the best fucking thing in the last 20 years, and that he was criminally misused by Hollywood. He was the perfect guy for a film like Midnight Run, but instead they stuck him in SRSAKSHN shit like Walking Tall and The Scorpion King (although the latter did lead to some awesome promos, in particular the one with The Hurricane. "The Rock knows who are you are... yeah, you're the Hamburglar... get The Rock a cheeseburger"), but he made it semi-big in the last couple of years with some enjoyable family comedies from Disney, based around sports. The Rock actually played for Da U back in the 90s, until he got injured and Warren Sapp took his place. But yes, the pro wrassle game ain't been the same since The Rock left for the lights and fame.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CErB205Zm_c"&gt;Then Raw, tonight, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5webrAZSBhY"&gt;THE ROCK WAS BACK&lt;/a&gt;. This is monumental. This is a big fucking deal. Sean linked me to a youtube clip, and it was glorious. The Rock was back in top form, calling out Cena for being a bitch-ass punk (fuck that You can't see me bit had me in stitches), and getting me so so hyped for Wrestlemania, way more than last year, which I was mostly excited for the Montreal Screwjob rematch. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mean, for those of you who don't know, The Rock was THE sports star back when WWF was blowing up over here. Fuck Austin and Kane and all those other guys, The Rock was the real star. He has infinite charisma man, and we all fucking thought he was awesome. &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnKxo1JAzVQ"&gt;He's responsible for the last good thing Wyclef did&lt;/a&gt;, and his catchphrases are all in the popular lexicon man, he had a huge influence. He was on Jonathan Ross promoting The Tooth Fairy last year, and he was just such a joy to watch. He can pull of any tone man (see his filmography, with the exception of the two films I've dissed), and he is just such a funny, talented dude.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But the clip, holy hell The Rock has not lost a step with his mic skills. At the end, like the whole bit where he gets the crowd to join in, fuck. He's all gettin' his haters to sit down, man, and getting everyone so excited. The People's Champ, back in all his glory, beating Cena's bitch-ass down at Wrestlemania. And I really hope it's a serious fucking beatdown, like Hart-McMahon at the last Wrestlemania, with The Rock being awesome left, right, and fucking centre. Aww shit, son, this is a big fucking deal. And dudes are seriously fucking hyped. Right now planning to get down to Frank's place with Fitzy and watch that shit LIVE FO REALZ, since The Rock coming back is pretty much the best shit to happen this year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh God this is just amazing. This is just, I mean he's The Rock, he's just far too cool man, I mean nobody should be allowed to be that awesome. He's so awesome, he could make Walking Tall, and still be one of the best dudes on the planet. Like he separated from his wife, and they decided to remain besties. If you tried that you'd get fucking laughed at, but The Rock can pull that shit off. Hopefully The Rock and CM Punk team up to make promos (The Rock has &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtMML_zdfxA"&gt;ALL THE BEST PROMOS. ALL OF THEM!&lt;/a&gt;) so amazing they single-handedly wipe out all the bad stuff the WWE has done in the last 5 years. IT COULD BE JUST THAT GOOD. Wrestlemania, mark the fucking date man, THE ROCK IS MAKIN THIS HAPEN!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I CAN SMELL WHAT THE ROCK IS COOKING, AND IT SMELLS SO AWESOME,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/02/rock-is-cooking-something-and-i-am-able.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4836158774494963598'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4836158774494963598'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-670511347536511178</id><published>2011-02-14T22:10:00.009Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.296+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='College'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Catching up'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><title type='text'>A Monday post, which ties into an unofficial holiday</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;Not a whole lot to say/it was an average Monday. First thing I had was my mapwork lab, which at first looked like it was gonna take a while, but soon I sussed it and I was finished within an hour. I'm only really finished that early because the demonstrators are so awesome though, one of them looks like a cool Bill Gates! I really enjoy the mapwork/physics Geology module, it's hells of interesting, and it's got some plate tectonics up in. Alfred Wegener sure showed his bitch-ass haters. They were all laughing at him back in the day but now we laugh at them! Catastrophism is the most ridiculous school of scientific thought that has ever been, oh yeah.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had a Geography term test too actually, which I got a 65 on, which hells of yes, I might get my first first. Also I worked a little bit on the survey project we have to do, but honestly it's not coming together great. We have good questions, but right now, there's no obvious correlation. Also need to find an online survey that lets you view individual submissions, since we need to make dem correlations, and you can't do that with rumps of data. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also my chemistry lab went pretty well, a II.I seems to be the standard lab mark my demonstrator is giving me, even though secretly she thinks I'm bound to fail come summer. I managed to be out early (obviously my new lab coat has powers, damn it just feels so crisp. I actually feel like a million bucks wearing it), and I got time to do some last minute revision for the test. I also got to read the Homestuck update, which eh who knew Hussie could write sapphic pirate/mind-control erotica? That man constantly finds new ways to surprise me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All in all, this term is going pretty well. I'm getting kick-ass chemistry grinds from an awesome dude who is mad helpful, and I'm even doing alright in the petrology module, which is a relief, since I suck at rocks, man, I'm just flat out terrible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That was pretty much my day at college. Even though I'm in 10-6 without any real break, I really love Mondays now, I get to do so much awesome stuff. I'm learnding! And the demonstrators and lecturers are also just really top notch, although Dr. Raleigh is the only lecturer I have on Mondays, but damn man, who knew statistics outside of baseball could be so interesting? She actually uses baseball examples, which is quite cool, since baseball is mad awesome for the statistics, although I don't fully understand the way they calculate some (what up VORP? I've actually started using OPS+ to judge value in my OOTP game, since it doesn't favour players with more plate appearances. ERA+ is also pretty useful, since I have no idea what a good VORP is for each of the different positions in my rotation), it's really interesting, and really cool. You should read &lt;i&gt;Moneyball&lt;/i&gt;, by Michael Lewis, and some stuff by Bill James too. &lt;i&gt;Moneyball&lt;/i&gt; is a pretty neat summation of sabermetrics in general, and is quite an entertaining read to boot.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I got home until now I haven't really done much. I played some Battlefront II with Larney before he went out, and then had some insanely tight NBA Live games with Domhnaill. It was pretty good craic, and I managed to break a chair in the excitement. It's no NBA 2k11, but NBA Live 2004 is pretty solid, and it's got nostalgia value to boot. Chris Webber! Reggie Miller! Mike Sweetney!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's actually been a while since I've done a post like this, which is more in line with the posts of last summer, which were, as a rule, short and boring. This one isn't really short, but I'm not going to assume anyone will find it to be interesting reading. Whatevz! Time to kick back and roam around Summer Forest in Spyro 2. The Summer Forest theme is just perfect relaxation music. Yes please!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also to tie it into Valentine's Day, here is a picture of a box of chocolates with a picture of Rainbow Dash that someone found in Walgreen's. How adorable. I remember the last time I was spoken for on Valentine's day I sent one of the cards The Onion put out. I can't remember what it said, or even if they liked it, but sending it made me feel all warm inside, as did the person in question. YAY!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JjOg3p1kaRY/TVmtW_Ogl7I/AAAAAAAAAFU/v2-3_oo90w4/s1600/Untitled.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 319px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JjOg3p1kaRY/TVmtW_Ogl7I/AAAAAAAAAFU/v2-3_oo90w4/s320/Untitled.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5573676624288716722" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sex with...

It sounded pretty interesting, and a large caffeine intake in the last couple of hours meant I wasn't sleeping so I decided I would try and do this. 30 songs, with a short note explaining why each was chosen.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;01 - Your Favourite Song - Michael Guy Bowman - How Do I Live?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a song from Homestuck, which I blogged about recently. A cover of the Diane Warren song from Con Air, this manages to be a Diane Warren cover that doesn't completely suck. This song on repeat is my Pump It Up mix, and I just fucking love it. Feels so good on my eardrums.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;02 - Your Least Favourite Song - Black Eyed Peas - I Gotta Feeling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I caved in and went for an obvious choice. I am weak. Originally I was thinking Not Afraid by Eminem, but although I hate it, it's not my least favourite. I Gotta Feeling is. For months, it was impossible to escape. You couldn't socialize for months without hearing this song and some girls and that one disgraceful dude screaming along to it. Dear God, it was fucking horrible. Mazel tov, motherfucker? Motherfucking Mazel tov? This shit is horrible. I'm swearing so fucking much that's how bad this is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;03 - A Song That Makes You Happy - Boston Spaceships - Tattoo Mission&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not a whole lot to say about this one. It's a happy, wonderful song from Robert Pollard's new band. It, like the entire album it's from, &lt;i&gt;The Planets are Blasted,&lt;/i&gt; is just a joy to listen to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;04 - A Song That Makes You Sad - Guided by Voices - I'm Cold&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first of what will no doubt be many Guided by Voices songs up in this thing. It's off Suitcase 1, that hodge-podge bootlegs collection Pollard put out a few years ago. The collection has a lot of good songs, including a piano-only version of Wondering Boy Poet, but this is my favourite. It's just really, really sad to listen to, and when I listen to it the sadness rubs off on me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;05 - A Song That Reminds You of Someone - Guided by Voices - Atom Eyes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Reminds me of Christine. Don't ask me why, I have absolutely no idea.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;06 - A Song That Reminds You of Somewhere - Steward Copeland - Summer Forest&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Damn, son. This instrumental from Spyro 2 just reminds me of a sunny day in the woods. It is blissful.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;07 - A Song That Reminds You of a Certain Event - Chumbawamba - Tubthumping&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;World Cup '98 in it's entirety. I was actually in France when it went down, which was awesome.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;08 - A Song That You Know All the Words To - Guided by Voices - Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This one is a cold hard classic off Bee Thousand, which is also completely awesome. It was when I heard this song that I fell in love with Guided by Voices, completely and utterly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;09 - A Song That You Can Dance To - Pen Ward and Olivia Olson - There Go Our Boys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I wouldn't really call what I do "dancing", but I can bug out to this one. It's from the first Marceline episode of Adventure time, and she's one of my favourite supporting characters. This song is just absolutely fantastic, so so catchy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;10 - A Song That Makes You Fall Asleep - Brian Eno - 1/1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first side of Music for Airports, this is completely relaxing, soothing bliss. I can use it to clear my mind, actually that applies for pretty much the whole album, which is the most perfect, brilliant double album ever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;11 - A Song from Your Favourite Band - Guided by Voices - No Sky&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's hard to choose just one Guided by Voices song, but in the end I'll pluck for No Sky, off &lt;i&gt;Under the Bushes Under the Stars. &lt;/i&gt;This is pretty straightforward and short, but like a lot of the UTBUTS songs, is completely effective. A+++++!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;12 - A Song from a Band You Hate - Black Eyed Peas - Boom Boom Pow&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;See number 2, fuck they are awful. With the exception of Hey Mama, which is actually alright. There's always one...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;13. A Song That is a Guilty Pleasure - I ain't some insecure dude who feels guilty 'bout digging awesome things. Get outta here!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Seriously, OH I LOVE THIS BAND BUT I AM WORRIED ABOUT PEOPLE JUDGING ME. I guess the closest any song comes is Winter Wrap-Up, I mean other people would feel guilty about that. But they shouldn't, it's fucking great.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;14. A Song That No One Would Expect You to Love - Kazumi Evans - The Art of the Dress (Stitching It Together)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is also a pretty awesome song. A rewrite of a Stephen Sondheim song (I forget which work it's taken from), this is catchy as hell. Suited for Success was such a good episode.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;15. A Song That Describes You - Guided by Voices - I Am a Scientist&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I racked my brain over this one, but in the end I went with the obvious choice, since I am pursuing a science degree, and I maintain a blog. I am a scientist, I am a journalist, I seek to understand me.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;16. A Song That You Used to Love But Now You Hate - Nickelback - Hero&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was like 11, and Nickelback were hot shit. How foolish we all were. But back then, we didn't have any quick way of playing double music, so we didn't realise just how bad Nickelback were.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;17. A Song That You Hear Often on the Radio - Eminem &amp;amp; Rihanna - Love the Way You Lie&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I did not like Recovery at all, it was really bad. But I've heard this song on the radio like 3 times since it came out, which is more than I've heard any other song in the last year, so it wins by default.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;18. A Song That You Wish You Heard on the Radio - The Protomen - Breaking Out&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So. Fucking. Brilliant. I mean if I had to hear a song on the radio, it would be this one. People need to hear this 9 minute epic about individualism and rebellion.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;19. A Song from Your Favourite Album - Bob Dylan - One Too Many Mornings&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Off &lt;i&gt;Live at "Royal Albert Hall"&lt;/i&gt;, this one is brilliant. It's an electric version of one of the sadder songs off &lt;i&gt;The Times They Are a-Changin' &lt;/i&gt;(which is saying something), and it's just so good, highlight from one of the best live albums ever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;20. A Song That You Listen to When You're Angry - Cursive - The Lament of Pretty Baby&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Can't really explain this one, but I just gravitate towards &lt;i&gt;Cursive's Domestica&lt;/i&gt; in general whenever I'm pissed off.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;21. A Song That You Listen to When You're Happy - Brian Eno - The Big Ship&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Perhaps the most beautiful piece of music ever recorded. Wow.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;22. A Song That You Listen to When You're Sad - Guided by Voices - Dayton, Ohio, 19-something and 5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This one is from the fanclub album, &lt;i&gt;Tonics and Twisted Chasers,&lt;/i&gt; Bob did with Tobin Sprout. It's also on the titular EP. It's live on the EP, but both renditions are heartbreaking, and it's Bob singing at his best. RECOMMENDED. Not so much the rest of &lt;i&gt;Tonics&lt;/i&gt; though, except for "Is She Ever?"&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;23. A Song That You Want Played at Your Wedding - Robert J! Lake - Softly&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Haven't really put much thought into it, but this piece is so beautiful, it wins.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;24. A Song That You Want Played at Your Funeral - Clark Powell - Homestuck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a beautiful piece of music. In Homestuck, it's actually used to soundtrack a montage of Egbert's childhood, and it's just an incredibly sweet moment, but in general the music is perfect for any number of moods and situations, especially funerals!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;25. A Song That Makes You Laugh - The Lonely Island - I Throw It on the Ground&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh dear God, this one is hilarious. "I'M AN ADUUUUULT". It's about a hipster who shows that he is not part of the system by throwing various things on the ground. Vintage Lonely Island.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;26. A Song That You Can Play on an Instrument - Billy Joel - Uptown Girl&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't even like Billy Joel, yet I used to be able to play this like the Dickens on piano. I might pick it back up to use as a party piece.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;27. A Song That You Wish You Could Play - Aphex Twin - avril 14th&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't think it can actually be played with two hands, but getting an extra one fitted to your body would be totes worth it if you could play this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;28. A Song That Makes You Feel Guilty - Guided by Voices - Acorns and Orioles&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not really sure why I chose this one. HOW MYSTERIOUS.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;29. A Song from Your Childhood - Shaggy and Rayvon - Angel&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It Wasn't Me was actually the first piece of music I bought for myself. Such a classic. Fuck. Shaggy was the man.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;30. Your Favourite Song at This Time Last Year - Emancipator - Old Devil&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I detailed why Emancipator was awesome in my &lt;a href="http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/2010-musics.html"&gt;Best of 2010 Music post&lt;/a&gt;, you should check that out and then listen to Emancipator!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I honestly thought I'd write more for each song, but eh so it goes. COMMENCE ARMCHAIR PSYCHOANALYSIS or whatever, or better yet, do your own!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Footix was the best mascot ever man,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/02/30-songs-all-of-which-hold-personal.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5595888129687530470'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5595888129687530470'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-2975974919264889822</id><published>2011-02-11T14:03:00.004Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.277+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Video games'/><title type='text'>ACTIVISION!</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href="http://www.destructoid.com/new-spyro-game-announced-will-interact-with-toy-line-193783.phtml"&gt;Goddammit.&lt;/a&gt; I actually had a few conversations with Fortenbro, spanning a couple of months, about why Spyro Trilogy HD (&lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiX4zzGiN6g&amp;amp;feature=related"&gt;not the recent one&lt;/a&gt;, let's pretend that whole thing never happened. I mean some of the character redesigns (especially Hunter), and the attempt at an epic mythos, were nice, but overall the games were weaksauce) would be the most baller shit this side of Hater Bot. Even though Activision owned the franchise, I held out hope. I mean, Kogrub would just jump on a money-spinning opportunity like a re-release. He'd get to make money off games Activision had nothing to do with! Alas, nothing happened. They're on the PSN store in North America, but I mean that's meaningless, because a) dammit bro HD! and b) a tenner per game?&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But still, the fact that a new Spyro game is being released gives me hope. &lt;a href="http://bulk2.destructoid.com/ul/193783-hd.jpg"&gt;Even if the character design ain't all that impressive&lt;/a&gt;, maybe if this game is a success Activision to grace us with a HD&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;remaster of Spyro. Sigh. It's never going to happen. I am sadcheetah right now. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This new game, however. Even if it does manage to be enjoyable, it still has all those action figure peripheral things being peddled by the Activision marketing juggernaut. Hopefully it will have some Eye of Judgment style appeal at the very least, but I mean maybe Activision will actually pull through and put out a good game. It can happen, right?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Aside: &lt;a href="http://www.atomicgamer.com/news/3288/guitar-hero-tony-hawk-true-crime-canceled"&gt;This news comes on the heels of Activision canning the Tony Hawk and Guitar Hero franchises&lt;/a&gt;, which it's about time. Hopefully the failure of these will show Kogrub that you can't just release endless shitty iterations of a franchise or charge insane prices for horrible peripherals. This means one of two things: 1) Kogrub is replacing these dead franchises with Spyro, which is slightly less dead, or 2) Kogrub will learn his lesson and lavish care and attention on the Spyro franchise, and give the developers freedom and space, and release the game at a reasonable price. lolololol as if number 2 will happen. The only really good thing to happen to Spyro recently was the cancellation of that animated film FROM THE DIRECTOR OF SPAWN, dear Jesus Christ no.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On the plus side today, a new MLP episode, this time about Pinkie Pie!

Once again, I made very little progress towards actually forming a kingdom. I was too busy pursuing an isolationist foreign policy, except when I was hating on the Greenwings. Fuck that clan man. And this was on easy difficulty. Fuck. But long story short, let us never speak again of the dark times that were Voskandora's chieftainship.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ancient Lore&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the marriage of Orlanth and Ernalda, our men and women stood guard with Elmal, making Elmal our main deity. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our clan’s earliest famous event was Jested’s Settlement, when Issaries the Talking God outwitted foreign deities in a difficult negotiation. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the Storm Age, we adopted strangers into our clan. Our worst enemies in those days were the trolls. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were originally a Balanced Clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the Dawn, we first awakened Orlanth, the Father. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our attitude toward dragons and their ilk was neutral; we did not go along with them nor actively make war on them. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1329&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When we arrived in Dragon Pass, we claimed more land than we needed, to grow into. We built a clan hall, some steads, and a shrine to Elmal. But when we left Heortland, we lost much of our connection with the gods. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1330&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The god-talkers predicted many piglets would be born this year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kentvent was bullied and insulted by a pair of Jenstali weaponthanes at their clan market. We sent for shamans to curse them. Shamans came and said they would curse the Jenstali for the low price of 15 cows. We accepted the arrangement. The shamans said that the spirits had entered the dreams of their targets, and rearranged the secret places of their souls. Soon we heard that the Jenstali had developed an unquenchable hunger for lichen, and an overweening passion for the company of their sheep. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bandits blocked our emissary to the Badger clan. Garstal and his forces killed and scattered them. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We approached the Badger clan with an offer of peace. We offered them payment. They were pleased by our generosity, and we ended the feud. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bandits blocked our emissary to the Greenwing clan. Urenstand attacked, but was wounded and had to return home. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Someone killed some of our horses. The weaponthanes were despondent, for by allowing this to happen we had shamed our patron god. We made the claim before their clan ring. They denied that they had slain our horses. Aransanda, who argued our case with them, thought they were lying. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Explorers encountered a bark-clad shaman who predicted an ice storm and warned against a mysterious crop of spears. We decided to find the shaman and offer to adopt him. They looked high and low for the shaman, but did not find him. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Humakti warriors said we should give them permission to enter our tula and fight the undead. We granted it, and gave them gifts. They praised us as an honorable clan. They tramped around our lands for many days, but did not find the creatures they were looking for. They were good guests, though, and did little to disturb us. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The harvest was poor. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The forces of cold and darkness attacked our land with snow and wind. Our herds were threatened. We called on Orlanth to help us against his ancient enemies. Soon after the sacrifices were made, the enemy storm lifted. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1331&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was an auspicious year for heroquesting. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Orendal spoke for the warriors when he said that they were stretched too thin, and that more fighters were needed. We sent Garstal on a mission to find the best warriors available. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Olende of the Greydog clan offered us gifts. We gave Olende a reciprocal gift. He said we were very generous, and that he would say so to others. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Robasart won a bet with the Narri chieftain, and won much grain. We gave them a gift in return. They praised our generosity. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Renatha, a member of the Rangdani ring, came seeking help against a gigantic wyrm. We offered to send warriors, but at a higher price. She named a price we liked better. They came back from the hunt carrying wyrm scales they had taken as trophies. They said that the Rangdani treated them fairly, paying what they said they would pay, and risking them no more than they did their own warriors. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Odayla cultists offered to perform a ritual to make the hunting better in our area. We accepted their offer, and gave them gifts. They thanked us for the gifts and departed, telling us that we would know when the ritual had been completed when the forest filled with elk. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our scouts found a strange clan of beast folk who were like ducks. With justice and mercy, we offered peace to the duck people, who henceforth gave our clan a place of honor in their songs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1332&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The god-talkers feared for our explorers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We found a cave full of dangerous, armored rodents on our tula. Robasart said he would lure them away with trickster magic. He pranced about the cave mouth, singing a song which he said was an irresistibly salacious tune in the language of the killer rodents. It seemed absurd, but the rodents formed a line and followed Robasart as he danced away from the borders of our tula and towards those of the Greenwing clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Someone killed some of our horses. The weaponthanes were despondent, for by allowing this to happen we had shamed our patron god. We sacrificed to Elmal Horse-Friend for protection from horse-killers. The god-talkers said that the signs were good; Elmal would protect us from such attacks in the future. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dangmag wanted vengeance against the men who had killed his father many years before. We sent a delegation to demand wergild for the slaying of Dangmag’s father. The Rangdani lawspeaker said that their clan should not be liable for actions taken so long ago, when Rostakos and Vandarl belonged to another, faraway clan. Furthermore, the two men had changed since they burned Randalyar. “They have renounced their brutal ways, and are now as judicious and honorable as any Orlanthi thane.” “Yet,” said their chief, Farnan, “in the interests of harmony between our clans, we will pay the wergild you ask.” &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Grivton led a delegation of weaponthanes to complain that the carls were being favored over them. We feasted in their honor. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the horse nomads. We were driven from the battlefield and looted. And they took 22 of our footmen captive. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were able to attract 56 new carls to the clan. They brought with them 44 children. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Robasart, the devotee of Eurmal on our clan ring, gave away a herd of our cows. We removed Robasart from the clan ring. The people said it was good to punish him, but that this was not enough punishment. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The harvest was poor. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Foul weather turned back our diplomatic mission to the Rangdani. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aransanda took ill, because someone had woven Chaos runes into her skirt. We sacrificed to Chalana Arroy. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Salinarg began the Elmal Guards the Stead heroquest. Orlanth left on his great quest, and Salinarg stayed to guard the stead. A Chaos creature called the Eater of Skin came and attacked. Salinarg protected himself with Orlanth’s shield. The creature ate at Salinarg where the shield could not protect him. Salinarg sang a song of comforting valor. The song wounded the creature, which made strangled sounds, and was forced to end its own chaotic keening. It slashed through Salinarg’s back and tore his innards from him. Salinarg thrust his spear at it. The spear pierced the creature’s eye, and it screamed in anger. The creature ripped at Salinarg with one of its seven mouths, and tore open Salinarg’s chest. Before the creature could remove the spear, it groaned and died; the people rejoiced. Our worshippers, back in the ritual ground, had a chance to help Salinarg knit himself back together. We gave of our clan magic. Salinarg knitted himself back together and everyone, whether from the Orleving clan or the Storm Tribe, rejoiced. More Chaos enemies came, including the Author of Sores. Salinarg clubbed her about the head. Her head came off, but leapt forward and tore at Salinarg’s chest. Salinarg buffeted her with the wind of Orlanth’s sword. The Author of Sores groaned; her sores closed up, and she did not like this, for the sores were the source of her power. She caused the skin of Salinarg’s legs to pop open, so that he could hardly stand. Salinarg lanced her with a spear. The Author of Sores shook and howled. Green muck oozed from the creature’s body, and it fell upon Salinarg melting whatever flesh it touched. As the muck seeped out of her body, it deflated. The Author of Sores was slain, and the people rejoiced. Once again, our worshippers were given a chance to help Salinarg knit himself back together. We gave of our clan magic. Salinarg knitted himself back together and everyone, whether from the Orleving clan or the Storm Tribe, rejoiced. Then came the Maker of Bad Growth, another Chaos enemy. Salinarg left the realm of the gods. The god-talkers were sure that we would face an incursion of Chaos in the days to come, and the people were frightened. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1333&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The god-talkers feared for our explorers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Starvation hit our clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A gigantic chaos creature appeared on the boundaries of our tula. It ate some sheep, and scared away the shepherds. We sacrificed to Urox for aid against chaos. While we prepared the sacrifices, the chaos creature ate some of our cows. The god-talkers said the signs were good; Urox would aid us in our battle. We attacked the creature. We slew the creature. It decomposed over a matter of days, and we had to keep everyone inside their steads. Where it died, nothing would grow. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We saw a rainbow; the people were cheered by this good omen. Because we were lucky, we embarked on a raid. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We raided the Greenwings and eluded their patrols. Loricon ended up unseen among the enemy’s warriors. He fought recklessly but not well, and fell in combat with the enemy. We drove the Greenwings from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their tula. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After many weeks at death’s door, Aransanda recovered from the illness caused by the hexed skirt. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Starvation hit our clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bandits blocked our emissary to the Greydog clan. Urenstand tried to bargain with them, but got nowhere. Urenstand and his forces killed and scattered them. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Acting as our emissary, Urenstand asked the Greydogs to make good on the obligation they owed us, and provide us with food. Urenstand asked for no more and no less than the usual amount. The Greydogs provided us with the food without complaint. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We wailed with woe as kinstrife struck us. Garrath was slain. We sacrificed to Urox, foe of Chaos. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Starvation hit our clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Uralda cultists sought aid in a great ceremony to prevent cattle sickness in a distant corner of Dragon Pass. We accepted their offer, and gave them gifts. They thanked us for the gifts. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Sarotar, a rebellious thrall belonging to the Greenwing clan, came to beg for our aid. He wanted us to protect escaped thralls from outraged Greenwing thanes. We sent a war party to fight the Greenwing thanes. We found them and did battle with them. They fought back fiercely, angered that we dared interfere in their clan affairs. Some of our people were killed, and others wounded. During our absence, Sarotar slipped his guards and rejoined his group. He and the other thralls escaped their pursuers. We later heard that they lived as outlaws and were eventually all killed by the people they preyed upon. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A delegation of the clan’s leading men raised serious complaints against the job Voskandora was doing as chief. We outlawed Voskandora for the mess she had made of the chieftaincy. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Trolls. We drove the Trolls off, and their survivors left without plundering our tula. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;While plowing the fields, the carls found something strange. It was the enormous skull of some kind of dragon creature. We used it to decorate our clan hall. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The dangerous rodents came back and bit children and horses. We decided to seek outsiders to exterminate the creatures. We found weaponthanes of the Wolf clan willing to do it, for half a cow worth of silver each. Many of them were wounded, and they blamed us for not warning them how dangerous these rodents were. They said that all of the creatures were dead. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Greenwings. Orlkensor realized that the enemy were being attacked by Orlanth’s spirits of retribution, the impests, who must have meant to punish them for breaking Orlanth’s sacred vows. He killed Greenwing fools who were too hapless to defend themselves. We drove the Greenwings from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1334&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The god-talkers predicted many piglets would be born this year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A milk-white calf was born into Orendal’s herd. Orendal kept the calf, and our herds increased. The carls were pleased by the ring’s decision. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Starvation hit our clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were able to attract 26 new carls to the clan. They brought with them 35 children. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Starvation hit our clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A beautiful woman appeared in the woods. Some said that she ensnared our men. We ignored the rumors. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The dangerous rodents came back and bit children and horses. We decided to seek outsiders to exterminate the creatures. We found weaponthanes of the Turtle clan willing to do it, for half a cow worth of silver each. Many of them were wounded, and they blamed us for not warning them how dangerous these rodents were. They said that all of the creatures were dead. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Harsaltar died of a terrible curse when plants sprouted from his body. We cast a curse-lifting spell on all of the people of the clan. 3 carls died. One of them was married; so we knew that he had committed adultery with the mysterious woman of the woods. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We discovered a large cache of bones and ivory in one of our tula’s valleys. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spirit-talkers showed up and asked if we needed anything from them. We asked them to sell us Spirit Fetches. We added the Spirit Fetch to our treasures. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Greenwings. We were losing the battle. Garstal stopped the warriors who were about to flee. Together they faced the Greenwings. We drove the Greenwings from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We could no longer afford to maintain our shrine to Ernalda. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1335&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The god-talkers predicted an unusual number of rats and vermin this year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Priestesses of Chalana Arroy said they would heal our sick and wounded in exchange for a future favor. We declined their offer, and offered them gifts in return. They declined our gifts, saying that it was not yet the time. The priestesses said little else, but the people saw that they were displeased, and so were displeased in turn. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Many of our sheep became sick. We sacrificed to Nevala, the sheep mother. The sick sheep were healed by Nevala’s grace. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;High-ranking members from the Orlmarth clan came to us to trade for our ivory. We offered them three wagonloads in exchange for 40 cattle. They weren’t completely pleased with this proposal, but they agreed to it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Brangbane and his family came from distant Esrolia, to ask for membership in our clan. We accepted them, and on that day they became Orleving. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Horse-Spawn. Barngradus caused great damage in a group of Horse-Spawn who were attempting to circle behind us. We drove the Horse-Spawn from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A representative of the carls protested to the clan ring, stating that they were tired of supporting a great number of priests and weaponthanes. We agreed that we had too many weaponthanes, and released some from our service. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wilms, a thane of the Blackrock clan, asked us for the details of the “How Things Began” story. We told him what he wanted to know. He thanked us and departed. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A band of very strange musicians asked for permission to play at our clan market. We accepted the offer. Bundalini’s All-Skeleton Band played, and people came from all over. We decided to forge new trade arrangements. We made some good deals, which promised to pay off in the next few seasons. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1336&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;All of the omens were unlucky. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The dangerous rodents came back and bit children and horses. We ordered our weaponthanes to exterminate them. They said the carls should have been ordered to block the cave entrance. Many of them were wounded, but they said that they killed them all. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We reorganized as a Peace clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Verlain, a hunter of the Orlmarth clan asked permission to hunt a great white stag on our land. We said he could hunt it in cooperation with our own hunters. Together, they caught the stag. It was a magnificent beast indeed, and there was glory enough for both clans. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Starvation hit our clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The people complained Arene made bad trade deals on the clan’s behalf. The other ring members publicly scolded her. Arene was chastened, and agreed to mend her over-generous ways. This seemed to mollify the people somewhat. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Priests and thanes from the Wolf clan come to request the right to adopt a baby, one they said would grow up to become a great hero of the Knowing God. We granted their request, in exchange for a gift of knowledge. They said they would be happy to tell us the tale of “Orlanth and Aroka” in return for the baby. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The harvest was plentiful. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Trolls. Barngradus wrestled with a troll for a full minute before they both fell wounded. We drove the Trolls from the battlefield, striking them down as they fled. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jotisan, a thane of the Rangdani clan, asked us for information about Bastakos, chief of the Hendart clan. He reminded us that we owed his people a favor. We endeavored to answer his questions. Jotisan asked us if Bastakos was a holy chief. We said, “Bastakos is as pious as the average Orlanthi chieftain.” Jotisan departed, and thanked us for the information. Not long afterwards, he returned to our tula to withdraw his thanks. “The information you gave us was mistaken at best and deceitful at worst. Our relations with the Hendarti have been sorely tested, and it is your careless words which are to blame.” &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1337&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was an auspicious year for heroquesting. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The ghosts of our dead warriors returned and told us that our actions shamed the clan. We sacrificed to them. They pronounced themselves pleased with the respect we had shown them, and vanished. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A beautiful woman appeared in the woods. Some said that she ensnared our men. We sent searchers to capture her. Our best hunters searched long and hard, using their most powerful magics. They brought the woman back to us, tied with ropes. She would not speak to us. Our storytellers thought her some kind of kin to the aldryami, or elves. We gifted her, and asked her to convey our goodwill to her people. She warned us that our men had been dangerously infected, because we had offended the elves. She told us how to mix a potion to cure the infection before it showed itself. She also said that the trouble with the elves would get worse, if we weren’t careful. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The dangerous rodents came back and bit children and horses. We ordered our weaponthanes to exterminate them. They said the carls should have been ordered to block the cave entrance. Many of them were wounded, but they said that they killed them all. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Aslandar, of the Turtle clan, asked us to give him grain, because we owed him a favor. We gave him more than he wanted. Aslandar praised our generosity, and said that all of Dragon Pass would hear of it. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The warrior Garnath, outlawed from his clan, came to us for refuge. We gave him an honored place in the chief’s hall. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Trolls. We took 5 captives from the Trolls. Garnath distinguished himself in the fighting. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were able to ransom the prisoners. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A squabble broke out between those who claimed descent from the founders of the tribe, and those whose ancestors were the remnant people adopted into the tribe during the Storm Age. We scolded the people for dividing into factions. Each side was offended that we had not reserved our hottest words for the other. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Greenwings. Although we held the field, we weren’t able to take any captives. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1338&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The clan would see endless legal squabbles in the coming year, according to the god-talkers. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Brangbane was caught with trade goods that he did not buy through the clan ring. We stood him up before his fellows, and held him out as an example of disobedience towards chosen leaders. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Acting as our emissary, Urenstand sought an alliance with the Kardarvi. Urenstand said to them, “It would be generous of you to help us in a time of need.” Their chief, Jenesta, agreed that our two clans should be allies. “Generosity is the prerogative of chiefs and kings,” Jenesta said, “and I am glad to extend to you our bounty and protection.” &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Outlaws blocked our emissary to the Greydog clan. Garstal and his forces killed and scattered them. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Acting as our emissary, Garstal sought a gift of magic from the Greydogs, who owed us a favor. He asked for less than the customary amount. They granted Garstal’s request and praised our generosity, because we could have asked for much more from them, in discharge of the obligation they owed to us. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The weaponthanes complained that they had not raided in years. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We raided the Greenwings. Jonrik, a Wind Lord of the Greenwings threatened to turn the battle against us single-handedly. Our own hero fired missiles at the Wind Lord until one struck home and got the Greenwing’s attention. Garstal challenged the enemy to single combat. The two warriors clashed. Jonrik was too much for Garstal, who took a horrible wound. We were driven off and had no opportunity to obtain booty. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Humakti warriors sought our help in a war party against walking corpses. We offered them hospitality. They refused us. “Do not attempt to weasel and cajole us!” their leader scoffed. “If you mean to refuse us, you can at least do so honestly.” &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An outlaw woman brought us a baby she had raised in a shield. She told us that the babe, Kallyr, would one day be a mighty warrior. We asked her why she was an outlaw. “My own outlawry is a long and sad story,” she said. “Let us say that it was a matter of wrong passion, and that I accept my punishment. This girl’s mother was also outlawed, and the child is the result of her shame. She is innocent of any blame, and needs a clan to grow up in.” We did as the woman asked, and took the girl in. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The harvest was plentiful. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A two-headed calf was born; the people saw it as an ill omen. We sacrificed to Urox for protection from chaos. The god-talkers said that Urox had heard our pleas. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1339&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The god-talkers said that Orlanth wanted us to make a pilgrimage to Mount Kero Fin. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Refugees come seeking aid. They said they had escaped from the Horse-Spawn. We adopted them as family. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The haughty horse nomads who called themselves Grazers, but we know as the Horse-Spawn, came to reclaim the refugees we had adopted. We told them we’d never seen their thralls. They swallowed our deception, and left our tula. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Greenwings raided us for 34 cows. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Greenwings. The Greenwing clan burned 4 steads. We were losing the battle. Jorator charged the Greenwings and our warriors followed his example. We were driven from the battlefield and looted. They burned 5 more steads. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dangmag led a delegation of carls to complain that we were too war-like, and that the crops were suffering as a result. To end the dispute, we compensated the aggrieved parties. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The harvest was plentiful. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mordrim the Stout came to trade for the White Calf. We accepted, but demanded a favor in the future. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gardrostan led a delegation of weaponthanes to complain that the carls were being favored over them. We thought their grievances exaggerated, and tried to make them see this, too. They agreed that they may have tried too hard to make their point, and that things weren’t as bad as they’d made them out. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ragged outlaws demand hospitality, and threatened us with a rain of hail sent by Gagarth, the outlaw god. We granted them hospitality. They ate an astonishing amount of food, and drank more ale than we thought human bodies could contain. They insulted everyone, and made a mess. Even their children got drunk and made trouble. We thought they would fall into drunken slumber, but they stumbled away into the darkness of the night, telling us that they looked forward to visiting us again in the future. The people were most displeased by their actions. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the Isoltings. Jorator was wounded while facing the Isolting charge. He rallied our warriors and attacked. Jorator’s wound slowed down his charge, and the Isoltings struck him down. Although we held the field, we weren’t able to take any captives. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1340&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The god-talkers said we should explore distant parts of Dragon Pass this year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Issaries priestess Sora Goodseller came to our clan and asked if we had any white horses to trade. We had no white horses. Embarrassed that we had no white horse, we gave her a feast instead. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Explorers encountered a bark-clad shaman who predicted that hunters would trespass against us, and then warned against a swarm of insects. We decided to find the shaman and offer to adopt him. They looked high and low for the shaman, but did not find him. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enastarra, daughter of Dorasor and Ferena, went missing. Her parents thought she was at Clan Rangdani, in the company of a former suitor, Loricon. We demanded compensation from the Rangdani. They agreed to our demand. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We found Greenwing hunters poaching deep within our territory. They paid for their effrontery with their lives. We later learned that the Greenwings, who already hate us, were planning bloody vengeance on us. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Swen of the Greydog clan offered us gifts. We threw a feast for thanes of Swen’s clan. They toasted our generosity, and said they would speak of it to others. Our people made merry, and also toasted the clan ring. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our herds dwindled, and the people grew restive. The ring members told them that we would sacrifice to Uralda. The people accepted this pledge. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1341&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eurmal laughed during Sacred Time, and said that misfortune would plague us until we replaced at least half of our clan ring. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We raided the Greenwings. We drove the Greenwings from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their tula. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Drought struck our lands. The spectre of starvation hovered over us. We sacrificed to Heler, but our pleas for help went unanswered. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Drought struck our lands. The spectre of starvation hovered over us. We went with Orlanth to help him free Heler from the dragon’s maw. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Venharl attempted the heroquest of Orlanth and Aroka. He was unable to enter the place of the gods. Enemies aided Daga and Aroka, and Heler remained imprisoned. Rain did not come. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Drought struck our lands. The spectre of starvation hovered over us. We sacrificed to Daga, the enemy god of Drought and Famine, hoping that he would show us mercy. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Rastorlanth and Inganna got divorced. Inganna made unreasonable claims on him for a settlement. Our lawspeaker argued that she was misusing the law. Inganna was affronted, and left for clan Jenestni, promising that they would take vengeance against us. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Glendara, a carl of our clan, said that her prize stallion, Tempest, had been stolen by Rangarda Dark-Eyes of the Greydog clan. Members of the clan ring tried to persuade her to forget the matter. She would not hear of it. “No argument can sway me, while that mangy, dug-dragging she-dog has my Tempest.” The clan ring offered her compensation. Glendara said, “It is not the trade value of Tempest that concerns me. It is the principle of the thing. By stealing my prize stallion, she has stolen my honor.” We launched a legal claim against Rangarda Dark-Eyes. We took our claim to her clan ring. Rangarda denied that she had anything to do with the disappearance of Glendara’s horse. Her clan leaders seemed to make an honest effort to determine the truth, but ultimately ruled that there was no evidence of wrongdoing on Rangarda’s part. Glendara was most displeased by this result. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1342&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It was an auspicious year for heroquesting. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sons and daughter of Glendara recovered the stallion called Tempest, which they found secreted away on the tula of the Greydog clan. They slew one of Rangarda Dark-Eye’s sons, and wounded another. We sent gifts to the Greydogs, to smooth relations with them. They praised us for our generous gesture, and gave us a reciprocal gift equal in value to our own. They said that we should consider the fighting between the families of Glendara and Rangarda as a personal matter, and one which would not interfere with the strong relations between our two clans. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Uralda cultists offered to perform a ritual to benefit our herds. We accepted their offer, and said we owed them a favor. They thanked us in kind, and said that the Kardarvi, which many of them belonged to, would one day take us up on that favor. They gathered up our cows and then walked around them seven times, whisking them with the Holy Tail. After performing a lowing dance, they pronounced the ritual complete. They departed, to the cheers and good wishes of the carls. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Starvation hit our clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Emissaries of the Rangdani clan sought our support in the Orlanth and Aroka heroquest. We sent a few worshippers to the ritual. Our worshippers enjoyed their lengthy pilgrimage to Orlanth’s holy place. The Rangdani’s Wind Lord was unable to complete the difficult quest, and their elders lamented what would doubtless be a continuing drought. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We saw a rainbow; the people were cheered by this good omen. Because we were lucky, we embarked on a raid. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We raided the Greenwings and eluded their patrols. Orlkensor, our war leader, took a serious wound and fell near Arene. She dominated the Greenwing warriors, just as Uralda dominated the bulls, and was able to heal Orlkensor. We drove the Greenwings from the battlefield, and were able to plunder their tula. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The White Horses raided us for 9 cows while we were raiding. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A couple from another clan offered to sell us Esra’s Basket. We paid what they asked.

Some background: Vernon Well is a baseball player, not a fantastic one, middle-of-the-range, capable of being both pretty good and downright awful. This year, Vernon Wells will have a base salary of 23 million dollars. There is no football player I can think of who makes such a high salary (top 25 in professional baseball), yet is such a terrible player. If you can think of one, consider him like Vernon Wells, and this post might be a lot easier to follow. But yes, between 2007 and 2014, Vernon Wells will have accumulated over 125 million dollars. This for a player who has not led his team to the playoffs once, and has made one All-Star appearance in that time. His base salary will only increase as the contract drags on, since it is back-loaded, yet he is not getting any younger and is unlikely to turn into Ted Williams any time soon. Despite all this, some team (the Angels) was actually desperate enough for alright-I-guess hitters to trade for this horrible contract, which got me to thinking: can Vernon Wells be harnessed for other things.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Can Vernon Wells be used to convince world markets that humans and corporations are still capable of the idiotic desperate spending that drives economic booms? "Look, we're paying this guy more than it cost to run Brawn GP when they won the World Championship, WE'LL BUY ANYTHING!!!" If used correctly, the Vernon Wells contract could solve so many problems: Vernon Wells could hire a massive training staff (not that it would help or anything), and slash American unemployment! Vernon Wells could fund the NEA! Vernon Wells could set up a PAC and run Pro-Steroids candidates for congress, thus giving him a chance to justify his salary! Vernon Wells could buy enough season tickets to sell out every Angels home game, and free up money for fans to spend on overpriced refreshments! Vernon Wells could bail out the struggling maple syrup industry in Vermont! Vernon Wells could run for Governor of California, and lift bans on performance-enhancing drugs! Vernon Wells could start his own network news channel, with a pro-Wells bias! The possibilities are endless, and the future is bright. Vernon Wells is your new bicycle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Over the next four years, Vernon Wells will cost 86 million dollars, yet, unlike Cristiano Ronaldo, whose cost was in that ballpark, there is absolutely zero hope that Vernon Wells will make any real money for his team. For that 86 million dollars, you could do all sorts of things. Buy Leeds United, fund several successful films, buy the distribution rights to Hercules in New York, and so on. All of these things, even owning Leeds United, are better business moves than trading for Vernon Wells and The Contract. You could even run an F1 team for a couple of seasons. I understand people think you need to spend money to make money, but there are levels of desperation, and this is somehow more desperate than casting Matthew Modine in your movie.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't even have anywhere to go with this. I am simply bewildered by this unbelievably stupid decision, that may even yet outdo Attilio Lombardo's reign at Crystal Palace for reckless, wasteful spending.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mean, Christ,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/01/is-vernon-wells-way-out-of-this.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4186343897160603281'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4186343897160603281'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-6693684129902975185</id><published>2011-01-25T01:19:00.003Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.294+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Video games'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Bros'/><title type='text'>Cashing In</title><content type='html'>Sadly no, I'm not selling this address to a squatter and taking the euro he would give me to buy a pack of noodles (I have like 6 in the cupboard, so I don't even need any soon), although I might move it onto Ryan's (cpttremendous.com) hosting so I can have my own fancy URL, sans blogspot. That would be so sweet. For now though, I'm gonna keep it here (there was a brief foray into the world of &lt;a href="http://myacehen.posterous.com"&gt;Posterous&lt;/a&gt;, but I just couldn't abandon all my pageviews).&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But all this talk about cashing in is just a handy in for the post I promised Frank about his band: Tony Stark, but also it allows me to write about why cheap cash-in games are damn stupid in the long run. But yeah, Frank's band, Tony Stark, which is more of a duo really (do you call duos bands? The wikipedia page about Chromeo indicates that you do not), although apparently Kevin serves as a kind of auxiliary guitarist, which means he might take them in directions interesting and left-field! They didn't call it Stark Industries, but Paddy said it was a pretty good name for a (probably vanity) label. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But as Frank has no doubt mentioned on his blog (&lt;a href="http://skankrandy.blogspot.com"&gt;My Awesome Hair and Me&lt;/a&gt;, the number 1 blog for people who were actually looking for weird but at the same time tame porn), his plan is to sell out and make it big. I'm not sure if you can actually make it that way any more, I mean even if you completely submit yourself to the tastes of the market, and actually sell a decent amount, unless you're already established (Eminem, whose last album was inexplicably popular), you're unlikely to see much money from it. And in addition to that, if you were stupid enough to sign one of those 360 deals, you'll see even less still (unless they've given you a vanity label, like Jay-Z, in which case you can make some money off whoever you've got on there, Cole and Electronica I think?).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But yeah, this leads into another thing: shitty licensed crap, man it frustrates me. And I'm not talking about Krusty Brand Eyewash, but like the things with real potential to a) solidify your fanbase and b) make mad Hamiltons yo. I mean, putting real money and effort into a licensed video game pays for itself man. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Take Goldeneye. That's still paying out over a decade down the line, they were even able to re-release it on the Wii, because they put the effort in when they made it, and ended up with an awesome product that everybody has fond memories of. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;To make an example of this, in 1997, another licensed game was released: (actually, aside, Civil War Generals II came out in 1997. Fuck that game was amazing, and after CivNet, the first strategy game I played hotseat with my bro, although we never did finish it) The Crow: City of Angels. This isn't an ideal example, the movie wasn't hugely successful, but The Crow has always had a cult following. But man was it ever panned. GameRankings gives it a user score of 23.5% (&lt;i&gt;Official Sega Saturn Magazine &lt;/i&gt;gave it a 67, and said "Best avoided", which seriously, a near 7/10 is "best avoided"? Game review ratings be fucked the fuck up. Like the conomy.), and if it were released on XBLA or VC or wherever, like maybe 2 people would buy it because of some /v/ thread. Even if there were a new Crow movie or product coming out (iirc, it was &lt;i&gt;Blood Stone&lt;/i&gt; that prompted the GoldenEye remaster), this cheap licensed cash-in wouldn't get that delicious upscalifyin' goodness.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is relevant mainly because two shows of which I am a fan, &lt;i&gt;Friendship is Magic&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/i&gt;, have had these licensed games suggested. Pen Ward, the creator of AT, actually posted some sketch art detailing what he'd like a DS &lt;i&gt;Adventure Time&lt;/i&gt; game to be like, and it seemed pretty sweet. It was really just Finn punching things, but who doesn't like that? And the other, FiM, is pretty much perfect for an RPG in the vein of those Sailor Moon ones from the 90s (or even a visual novel, which I've seen screens of one someone started on in RenPy, but they're a couple of months old and no progress seems to have been made since). Yet, right now we're limited to some cheap flash games on their respective websites, and if there were to be full games made for it (most likely the DLC games you do find on the Live Arcade and the Network), they'd be some cheap pitiful shit, especially FiM, which would most likely be some god-awful horrible off-model crap (nothing new there then, ho ho ho).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is to be expected though. One has grown accustomed to the myopia of film studios and networks with regards to game licensing. Although recently there have been some excellent licensed games (Toy Story 3 in particular, and also Scott Pilgrim, and Arkham Asylum. A good Batman game WAT IS DIS?), the prevailing trend is still that of a cheap cash-in with little effort, and you can find countless examples crowding the pre-owned vidya section of any merchant. But really, putting effort into it can increase the lifespan and revenue of a franchise. Even the cash-ins of a game franchise itself, like the karting game, can yield excellent results (Crash Team Racing, obv). Like people are still talking about the Toy Story 3 game, and it helps the franchise in the long run, since now, assuming the movies are over, a whole new revenue stream can be cultivated with loving care, and people are insanely hyped for &lt;i&gt;Arkham City&lt;/i&gt;, which looks just insane, how HIGH do you even have to BE to come up with that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That wraps it up, there isn't really a closing statement to be made that I can think of right now, although if one appears to me, I might edit this post after the fact to include it. Also, apparently WorldStar was closed down, and nothing of value was lost.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;THE RUDEST,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/01/cashing-in.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6693684129902975185'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6693684129902975185'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-6584076192361109714</id><published>2011-01-24T07:35:00.001Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.292+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Food'/><title type='text'>Mornin' Bloggin'</title><content type='html'>I don't know why I never had pancakes for breakfast before now.

I told Graw I'd give it a listen if I could find a download link, so I opened up google and typed in "James Blunt [album name I've forgotten] mediafire" and nothing came up, so it didn't happen. That's probably for the best, since it's a 45 minute long album, and while Blunt isn't as bad as Limp Bizkit or some other horrible metal act that people inexplicably cream themselves over (listening to people talk about metal is kind of like watching dudes compare their dicks, except kind of painful physically and mentally) but he's still pretty bad. So yeah, that's not happening, so as a result I'm listening to Das Racist on headphones with the volume way up to try and drown out "Mrs. Brown's Boys".&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you're not familiar with it, it's basically the Irish equivalent of Madea's Awkward Moralizing Against a Backdrop of Bad Comedy. It's got the same cross-dressing old lady, bad jokes, and jarring tone shift towards the end where suddenly there is time for an Important Moral, or Character Filibuster or something else that completely does not gel at all and is made worse than it actually is by the fact that this serious, dry moralizing is coming during a horrible comedy.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I might also watch Sonatine, which is this movie Beat Takeshi made before his motorcycle accident, so he still has facial expressions in it, but it's a movie where a yakuza, facing death, heads out to a beach to chill with his crew and await death. It's a weird, beautiful movie, and it also has a fantastic score from Joe Hisaishi. I'll probably cop that ish if it gets a European blu-ray release (see also: FLCL, still not entirely sure if that's dropping over here, although it's not a massive blow if it doesn't thanks to Mully), but right now I'll have to make do with the fansubbed dvd rip.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also I've played two games today which are worth comment. The first, Spare Parts, is part (hurr durr) of EA's new interest in putting out mad fresh IPs, which is certainly a welcome change (theory: Like the HIMYM episode about the Blitz, there is a Curse of Shovelware and Franchise-Whoring that follows around publishers for whatever reason. Activision is the current holder of this curse). It's a co-op platformer (although it has single player), where you play as two robots tasked by SIMON PEGG SUPER COMPUTER with collecting some ship parts. I only played the trial, but it was solid. The platforming reminded me of early PS2 games, back when platformers still got made on the regular, and it has some nice design. I might pick it up next week to play with my bro, since apparently it has like 10 hours of gameplay, which YEAH!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The second game is ModNation Racers, which I picked up on eBay for a tenner, cos I was looking for a current-gen karting game with some couch multiplayer, but I got way more than I expected. Like LittleBigPlanet, it sells itself on the Play.Create.Share thing, where, in addition to the levels and characters and stuff that come with the game, you can also download USER-CREATED CONTENT! &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;LittleBigPlanet dropped the sack massively on this one. A) Browsing levels was an actual pain and B) 90% of the levels fell into 3 or 4 categories, and didn't do anything interesting. For every interesting level I found, like the one where you played a ninja infilitrating a castle, or where you played through Where the Wild Things Are, there were 100s of shitty SHARK DODGING!!! levels. The second one seems to have remedied this with www.lbp.me, and maybe if it still has Stephen Fry it might be worth it when the price drops. Also there are already dozens of KILL OBAMA!1! or equivalent levels, which is hilarious. THEY HAVE COMPLETELY DISCREDITED THE PRESIDENCY, NOW EVERYBODY ACCEPTS THE BIRTHER TRUTH!!! I'm all for expressing your political views, but surely an internet forum or a phone call to one of those talk radio shows is a better way of doing it than creating a level that maybe 2 people will play tops. (Out of curiosity, I searched Biden, but got nothing. Oh well...)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But back to ModNation Racers. Fuck yes, worthwhile user-created content in spades! You could, if so disposed, basically turn the game into [Franchise] Racer, since there are enough player-characters for say Mario or Bomberman to do that. It's actually really impressive, as are the karts. But the greatest thing is the track creator, which holy fuck it is fantastic, and you can completely dictate the computer's level of involvement. You can get it to auto-complete and -populate a track, or do the entire thing by hand, and it is very, very in-depth. Although it only has a limited number of environments, you can still bend it so you get something different every time. And this is just me dicking around with it for 15 minutes, who knows what it's true potential might be! It could be like the M.U.G.E.N. of karting games, but actually balanced! I even got Iron Man and Rayman and Finn and Jake. STEAK SAUCE!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's all there is to blog about now. I'm working on an interactive fiction story, which I'll post the intro up here when I've made more progress. Also apologies to Graw if she reads this, I just could not find that James Bunting album.

Actually though coming across a really personal blog that gets no comments and just stops is actually one of the saddest things on the internet, for my money anyway (Aside, where has Lie Bot been in Achewood, I can't even remember the last time he was around). &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But anyway, to get back into it, I was wondering what would be the best way to isolate all my readers: A post about rap music? A post about ponies? Perhaps some combination of the two (insert horrible MC-[character name] puns or some such here)? Anyway I can devote slightly more time to blogging now, since my geography paper and the accompanying writer's block are now finished, and we can return to the long posts about insignificant minutiae.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The only thing of note I can think of is I was listening to Patton Oswalt around college yesterday and he had a line that summed up perfectly why I'm so apathetic about the new rappers XXL and all those shitty rap blogs are getting all excited about. It's a bit where he talks about why he loved open mic nights in the 80s.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"...and you got to see.... 1: People who were clearly gonna be good comedians, they had a point of view, they were struggling, they had something to say. 2: People who were funny, but who gives a shit?"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;I mean I still listen to quite a lot of rap music. And there are "veterans" (I use that term loosely, I basically mean they've been around long enough that the industry can't pass them off as a "new act" at the Grammy Awards) like Madvillain and El-P and OutKast, who I'll browse as quickly as possible to wherever their new albums are available. But, except for Das Racist and maybe Yelawolf, the "new" rappers that everyone is excited about fall, for me, into Oswalt's second category. They're good and all, but it's just like "why should I care? You are not making me care. Make me care!" and then they fail to make me care. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;I mean they can rap, they aren't lulzily bad like, say, Asher Roth or Chet Haze, the Tom Hanks offspring who is rapping about college, or Charles Hamilton, who is basically a more ridiculous Tyrone Biggums at this point, but they don't remind me of those guys who were really good for a brief period, like Das EFX or whatever, but more like the countless guys in the early- and mid-90s who were competent, but completely faceless and anonymous, like their career peak was having a guest verse with someone who was tangentially related to Death Row. It's sad, but I guess there's nothing to do about it except acknowledge it briefly, as I have just done.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I guess I could probably get something longer out of it, but the apathy is so great I can't even manage that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Blah blah blah,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/01/infingerment-of-copyrights.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/110056300736545047'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/110056300736545047'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-9108606117291924134</id><published>2011-01-03T19:50:00.005Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.306+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Catching up'/><title type='text'>Sales and Bomberman</title><content type='html'>I'm pretty much blogging instead of working on my geography paper due in 2.5 weeks because it's coming together so slowly, whereas with a blog I can roll off 1,000 words in less than an hour, it's unreal.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd actually started a thing about Rapidshare and isolating users, since my Rapidshare Pro expired today, but there was no central point emerging, and it wasn't going anywhere, so it's in the recycle bin. Wait, it's been emptied, it's gone forever. It's probably for the best, since it was turning into a long thing about the TF2 Mann-conomy, which I think nobody but Fitzy even knows about. So I suppose the thing to fill the void left by the deletion of that formless post is a LIFE UPDATE, the first of the year, and maybe a throwback to the horrible first season of this blog, where every post was 2 sentences long and pretty boring. This is gonna buck the trend tho', in that I'm gonna pick up on things I notice and write at nauseating length about them. ALL VERBOSE UP IN THIS, GIRL.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first thing is probably what I'm doing right now, which is listening to &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zSgiXGELjbc"&gt;this awesome song&lt;/a&gt;, which you've probably heard, by Symphony of Science. Oh fuck, it's just so catchy, and Carl Sagan's hand movements in the wormholes section are just incredibly gangster. He was so hardcore. Apart from disproving the stoner stereotype (Carl Sagan smoked cannabis regularly, and was one of the greatest minds of the 20th century, in my opinion anyway), &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p86BPM1GV8M"&gt;he also could speak beautifully about space&lt;/a&gt;.  I mean that's downright beautiful right there, it's goddamned poetry. It's one of those songs I've been listening to on repeat recently. There are &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyrAkwJ6WsY"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWsvkW6rKkQ"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iR6oYX1D-0w"&gt;others&lt;/a&gt;, but right now this one is monopolizing my time. I have Cosmos lying around somewhere actually, so I'm gonna fire that up at some point, since Carl Sagan Does a Documentary about the Stars sounds like the best thing ever.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So far this year has been uneventful. The aforementioned geography paper moves forward with the speed of separating plates (HURR DURR), and I haven't hung with any of my top bros yet, although that may be changing tomorrow, as both Fitzy and Frank, as well as perhaps Ri, will be in Dundalk. Since the sales this year were honestly pretty shit (Amazon and Steam excepted, but it's a given that they'll deliver with their sales) and the one thing I did pick up, Super Street Fighter IV, was returned post-haste since it was a steaming pile of crap. Gamestop had a pretty tempting for 3-for-2 thing on preowned games on, but I couldn't even find 3 games at decent prices. I mean Backbreaker at €25 is a bit ridiculous, although once it gets cheaper I am going to pounce on that, brother, and the prices combined with the GameStop returns policy meant my wallet did not throw up some money to it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I did buy a couple of things in the Steam and PSN sales though. I got that recent Bomberman Ultra, for the multiplaya (up to 7-player local, fuck yes HudsonSoft!), and all the Half-Life stuff I did not yet own (Episode 2, Deathmatch, and Blue Shift/Opposing Force for the first one). Altogether it came to 7 euro for all of that, which you couldn't even find something that cheap in Gamestop, unless it was maybe Shaq Fu for the Jaguar or something. Overall though, I didn't get that much in this Steam sale. I bought the 2 Humble Bundles, and Super Meat Boy and Sam and Max season 3, which were both something like 70% off. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But Bomberman is holy good. I was gonna hold off and wait for Battlefest to come out, but a quick visit to the Metacritic showed its reviews were none too hot, while Bomberman Ultra, the current PS3 iteration, had a healthy 84. This is the first time I've played old school Bomberman since I was 6, but IT'S SO ADDICTIVE. Plus it's got 7p couch multiplayer, which FUCK YES THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I WANTED. This has completely wiped from my memory Bomberman: Act Zero, probably the lulziest grimdark shit ever made (it manages to be worse than Loonatics: Unleashed, which a full episode needs to be watched to appreciate how bad it is). It also has a mad variety of nice novelty costumes, all of which gel perfectly with the classic Bomberman design.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;(Aside about Act Zero: It's perfectly possible to make a really good story with well-rounded characters of what might seem like ridiculous and slight material (e.g.: Sonic SatAM, and Friendship is Magic, two shows that seem horrible on paper, but are both extremely good), and you could make a really enjoyable animated series out of Bomberman, but Act Zero just drops the ball horribly. I'll write about this more at a later point.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's pretty much all the major stuff. I've started cycling again, and I'm rewatching Planet Earth in 1080i, because who the fuck can get enough of all dat nature. UMMMMPPPPPH. I'm watching the Big Fat Quiz right now actually, goddamn this is hilarious, Richard Ayoade is so goddamned awesome.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bomb up!,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2011/01/im-pretty-much-blogging-instead-of.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/9108606117291924134'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/9108606117291924134'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-8246600374673774584</id><published>2011-01-01T20:57:00.008Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.304+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Graphs'/><title type='text'>The year in statistics: A review of My Ace Hen's first year through numbers</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So 2010 is over, which means that my blog as a regularly updated web entity has had a year in existence (Well, not a full year, but like, most of 2010). I wasn't sure what I wanted the first post of 2011 to be, so I decided to cop-out and have a look at the last year statistically. In a word, it was:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;Not particularly remarkable, I didn't break 1,000 page views, and probably the only remaining Yahoo! Browser user in the world visited a couple of times, but anyway, I'm just gonna put it out here for posterity, and also to show off my e-peen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) Pageviews by Country&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TR-eUQAEzDI/AAAAAAAAAEw/bwbydmIeFA8/s1600/Pageviews%2Bby%2BCountry.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TR-eUQAEzDI/AAAAAAAAAEw/bwbydmIeFA8/s320/Pageviews%2Bby%2BCountry.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5557334535928335410" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 206px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This was pretty weird. As expected, Ireland was the main source of pageviews, but really confusing are the small countries, and also Denmark, which all of those views are from the last 2 days. I can explain within reason where the American, Latvian, and British views came from, but where did the rest come from? I be at a serious loss, but also maybe it means I'd fit in well in Denmark.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) Pageviews by Operating System&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TR-fC0N_ZqI/AAAAAAAAAE4/hJpQEegSJKk/s1600/Pageviews%2Bby%2BOS.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TR-fC0N_ZqI/AAAAAAAAAE4/hJpQEegSJKk/s320/Pageviews%2Bby%2BOS.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5557335335924360866" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 192px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center; "&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;This one isn't really surprising at all. Windows dominates, natch, and Mac's audience share here is within +/- 1% of the actual figure. Linux is a lot higher than expected though, and portable devices (mostly iOS, although apparently someone browsed here on a PSP) are lower, but do people read blogs on portable devices? It would've been sweet if it had a more detailed breakdown of Windows by version, just to see how many dudes are still on that Vista ish, but it's still cool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left; "&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) Pageviews by Browser&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TR-f4B5lDfI/AAAAAAAAAFA/wHApVPTyJqw/s1600/Pageviews%2Bby%2BBrowser.png"&gt;&lt;img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TR-f4B5lDfI/AAAAAAAAAFA/wHApVPTyJqw/s320/Pageviews%2Bby%2BBrowser.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5557336250129911282" style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-left: auto; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 192px; " /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;This is the one where the audience share here has the greatest deviation from usage share in general. Internet Explorer is the biggest here, but its share is about 12% lower, while Firefox has a 2 point bump, and Chrome gets the biggest bump of all, with 29%, whereas the actual usage share is 12.4%. Safari and Opera are a lot smaller with share, Safari's is half its actual size, while Opera (actual figure 2%) didn't even get enough pageviews to warrant a single %.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;4) Pageviews by month (July-December)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TR-inGFeEHI/AAAAAAAAAFI/hwwquRm-KF8/s1600/Pageviews%2Bby%2BMonth.png"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 192px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TR-inGFeEHI/AAAAAAAAAFI/hwwquRm-KF8/s320/Pageviews%2Bby%2BMonth.png" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5557339257730633842" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Nothing surprising here, when I completely stopped blogging in mid-August, until I resumed in November, traffic plummeted.

DFW is certainly my favourite author, and he was just a flat-out phenomenal author. He wrote the best novel of the '90s, &lt;i&gt;Infinite Jest,&lt;/i&gt; as well as some of the best essays I've ever read (&lt;i&gt;Up, Simba&lt;/i&gt; is probably my favourite), and when he died he was working on a novel that is, if I recall correctly, about tax accountants who discover a deep secret to life. The excerpts that have been published so far (mostly in The New Yorker, I think) have been phenomenal, especially &lt;i&gt;Good People&lt;/i&gt;. Supposedly only about 400 pages of it is finished, and the rest is gonna be notes, but I have faith it will be awesome, since Michael Pietsch is overseeing the whole thing, which should keep it great and close to the original vision.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Habibi - Craig Thompson (Graphic Novel)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't know a lot about this, other than it's a love story between a eunuch and a prostitute. But it's by Craig Thompson, whose previous graphic novel, &lt;i&gt;Blankets&lt;/i&gt;, was really beautiful. I like old middle-eastern architecture a bit, so it should look nice at the least. Hopefully it can be as awesome as his last book was.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Avatar: Legend of Korra (TV Show)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is a miniseries, which means at least there's no risk of it being cancelled before the ending is reached. This is a sequel to Avatar: The Last Airbender, which I've blogged about before, and this has the same creative team of "Byrke" behind it. Apart from the really intriguing steampunk setting of Republic City, and also some exploration of anti-bending (I'm really hoping it turns out the cabbage merchant started it all, but that might be a bit too cute, plus did he even know the Gaang was led by the Avatar), but also it makes long-lasting Kataang canon. The concept art also looks badass, and The Track Team is back doing the soundtrack, so everything is in line for one of the best shows of the year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Game of Thrones (TV Show)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I ain't know a whole lot about this to be honest, but HBO getting into fantasy, especially getting into it with such a good series is excellent. It's also got a great cast, Lena Headey, Peter Dinklage, Sean Bean, plus David Benioff and Dan Weiss are writing, so it should be at the very least entertaining.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Source Code (Film)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another thing I ain't know a whole lot about, but Duncan Jones + Jake Gyllenhaal = High Potential for Fucking Awesome.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moneyball (Film)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I kind of want to see what Soderbergh would have done with this, especially the animated Bill James segments I heard so much. Anyway this is based on the book about Billy Beane using Sabermetrics to build a cost-effective baseball team. Aaron Sorkin is writing it now, and Bennett Miller is directing, and they've assembled a great cast, including Philip Seymour Hoffman and Brad Pitt, so this could be as good as &lt;i&gt;The Social Network&lt;/i&gt; was.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Portal 2 (Video Game)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's like the first &lt;i&gt;Portal&lt;/i&gt;, but longer, and with Wheatley the charming English personality core! Plus the people behind &lt;i&gt;Tag: The Power of Paint&lt;/i&gt; are working on it, which oh fuck. Plus it's Valve. ALL SIGNS POINT TO AMAZING.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Last Guardian (Video Game)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I can't really write much about a lot of the things on this list.&lt;i&gt; The Last Guardian&lt;/i&gt; is no exception. So I'll just say, TEAM ICO ON THE PS3, YOU KNOW YOU FUCKING WANT THIS.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new Madvillain album (Music)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is coming out in 2011, right? IT JUST HAS TO? It's been way too long since &lt;i&gt;Madvillainy&lt;/i&gt;, and that remix album was just not enough. I really dug the song they did for the Adult Swim Singles Project, and I mean if it's even half as awesome as the first one, it'll be out of sight of any chain that it could be attached to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;A new El-P album (Music)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think this is scheduled to come out in 2011. He even has a blog for it (www.cancer4cure.blogspot.com), although he doesn't really update it that much. I really liked the song he did for the last Def Jux compilation, and all the shit he's been doing lately in general (in particular, the Young Jeezy remix, the Das Racist guest verse, and &lt;i&gt;How to Serve Man&lt;/i&gt;), so I mean again if it's up to the work he's done lately, it'll cruise to Best Album of 2011.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Things I'm excited about, but there's a good chance they might suck&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;SSX: Deadly Descents (Video Game)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;FUCK YEAH A NEW SSX GAME, EA YOU ARE THE BEST PUBLISHER EVER. That was my first reaction when some new SSX urls were trademarked. All those glorious colours in HD, my brain was melting at the prospect, but then I saw the trailer. Which, eh...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It looked like Call of Duty. FUCK NO EA THIS ISN'T WHAT I WANTED. They've gotten rid of the beautifully designed, exaggerated circuits and replaced them with real mountains, which is a pretty sweet concept, but I mean if they go grimdark with this...&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But hey, it's from the Skate 3 devs, and although I don't think the analog-stick trick system will work as well here, I have faith in their abilities. I just hope it's not misplaced.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Looney Tunes Show (TV Show)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The small amount of dudes on DeviantArt losing their shit over the Lola redesign was hilarious. But aside from that, I mean this sounds interesting. The Looney Tunes would work well in a sitcom setting, and although John K. isn't working on it anymore, hopefully it will preserve some of his spirit. The redesigns look pretty good for the most part too, apart from the whole 3D Roadrunner and Coyote shorts, which FIRE THE PERSON WHO CAME UP WITH THAT.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's pretty much it. 12 things to look forward to in 2011. I'm expecting at least 10 of them will be awesome, I'm still not sure about the direction the new SSX is taking. WHERE MY MOBY AND MAC AT? But still, it's a lot to look forward to.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;See y'all next year,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/2011-things-to-be-excited-about.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6962359472004819430'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6962359472004819430'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-8190067505223894531</id><published>2010-12-31T18:16:00.003Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.303+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lists'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Some New Years Resolutions, which hint at the possibility of drastic change.</title><content type='html'>So 2010 is pretty much over so it is time for the most broken of all resolutions, the New Years ones.

This year was pretty good for films actually, Inception made a shit load of money, and Sorkin and Fincher had a glorious team-up. Other chill shit happened too, bro, but I didn't make it to the cinema as often as I did in previous years. But anyway, let's move right on to My Ace Hen's Best Motion Pictures of This Calendar Year, Being the Two Thousandth and Tenth Year of Our Lord. The post will probably be a bit shorter than the other four, and before the year is out I'll also be doing a RESOLUTIONS post, a MISCELLANEOUS AWARDS UNRELATED TO THE PREVIOUS FOUR CATEGORIES post, and an EXCITING THINGS IN 2011 POST&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (dir. Edgar Wright)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Going into 2010, I hadn't really experienced any Sorkin at all, so I wasn't excited about The Social Network. The main film I was pumped for was this one, where Edgar Wright was adapting a Canadian comic I hadn't read or heard of before, but hey, it was Edgar F. Wright, it had to be good?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh fuck it was. I actually went out onto the internet and found the comics in .cbr format, and read them the day before I went to see it, and lord I wasn't disappointed on either count. Although the comics have pretty extreme SAMEFACE, they're pretty funny, but the film went above and beyond that (unlike a certain OTHER adaptation of an awesome thing, M. Night, what up?), and had some great acting, choreography, music, and cinematography. It's just a pretty awesome film all around, and y'know, I'm guessing if you read this blog you've already seen it, but if you haven't, go watch it anyway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Toy Story 3 (dir. Lee Unkrich)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I don't really need to say much here. More of the same Toy Story you know and love, with added sad moments and Michael Keaton. Fuck yeah.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. The Town (dir. Ben Affleck)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ben Affleck? More like Ben Awesome! Although he was sort of a byword for shitty movies during a lot of the 2000s, I really think Affleck is one of the best directors going today. Sure he's only made 2 films, but they were both fucking great. Like the last one, &lt;i&gt;Gone, Baby Gone&lt;/i&gt;, this is a thriller set in Boston, but it's got an even better cast. Jon Hamm! Chris Cooper! Blake Lively! Jeremy Renner! Affleck himself! It's a film I can't write about extensively without giving away too much, but if you liked those old thrillers from the 70s and late 60s, then peep this ish, brother.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Inception (dir. Christopher Nolan)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Or, the film where there wasn't really a twist, but everyone assumed and insisted there was one. This is, for my George Wash onna dosh, the best film Nolan's ever done, better even than Memento.  Apart from the gully cast typical of a Nolan film (DiCaprio, Hardy, Murphy, Cotilliard, Watanabe, Caine, Page, Berenger, Postlethwaite, Gordon-Levitt), this also features his best set-pieces. The snow fortress!, The van!, The chase!, holy fuck they're all so good. This film, as you may already know, concerns dudes who go inside brains and perform theft, basically. Again, I can't give away too much, but that's mostly because I can't do this justice. It's got an incredible protagonist, and a great supporting cast (Eames is mai husbando), a really nice score from Hans Zimmer, and some kickass action, and beautiful cinematography from Wally Pfister. I copped the blu-ray of this one, and fuck it looks downright beautiful. I'm pretty sure all my regular readers have seen it, but y'all needs to rewatch it, it rewards that kind of behaviour.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. The Social Network (dir. David Fincher)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Fuck. This is an embellished tale of the founding of Facebook. A lot of tech writers got themselves into a frenzy about this one, replicating the exact kind of behaviour they criticize old media writers of (one in particular attempted to give a complete analysis of the film's Mark Zuckerberg, while admitting to having not seen it. Way to go, idiot.), which I found infinitely entertaining, just like the film itself. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;2010 was the year in which I discovered Aaron Sorkin, writer of A Few Good Men, Charlie Wilson's War, The West Wing, The American President, and Sports Night, to name his best, and The Social Network punches at their weight. It's got the same amazing dialogue typical of his work, and it meshes beautifully with the Fincher's faultless style. This is a film I could rewatch again and again and again, and although if one were to describe it, it might sound cliche (HE INVENTS A TOOL TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER, BUT HE HAS NO FRIENDS, et cetera) but typical of both Sorkin and Fincher at their best, this is truly transcendent. I mean this just blew me away 110%, FUCK. The acting is also incredibly impressive too, not least Armie Hammer (who I'd kind of written off as a dolt before this, because of the Justice League and Billy Graham films) and Justin Timberlake, who absolutely shines as a Sean Parker who is nothing like the real Sean Parker. I'm going to reserve a longer, more in-depth analysis of this film for when I cop the blu-ray in spring, but until then, I can only encourage that you watch this in the strongest possible terms. This is real fucking cinema.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;HONOURABLE MENTIONS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;How to Train Your Dragon&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kick-Ass&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Easy A&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;HOW THE FUCK COULD YOU FUCK UP SUCH GREAT SOURCE MATERIAL, or, PROOF THAT UNBREAKABLE WAS JUST A FLUKE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Last Airbender&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;OTHER FILMS THAT SUCKED REALLY HARD&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alice in Wonderland&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Edge of Darkness&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For Colored Girls&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Alpha and Omega&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILMS THAT WERE BALLS TO THE WALL AWESOME, BUT CAN'T BE INCLUDED BECAUSE OF STAGGERED INTERNATIONAL RELEASE DATES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A Prophet&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Secret of Kells&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Summer Wars&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;FILMS I WANT TO SEE, BUT I HAVE YET TO EXPERIENCE THEM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Blue Valentine&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Winter's Bone&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Black Swan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That about wraps it up, again, if there's any films you dug that I missed, message or comment with them, and I'll check 'em out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's a wrap,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/2010-motion-pictures.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6846161168106612436'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6846161168106612436'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-4431802399776690362</id><published>2010-12-31T16:18:00.004Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.282+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Television'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>2010: The Serialized Photoplays</title><content type='html'>This is the second last of my 2010 IN REVIEW series. The last one about music blew up, receiving over 50 hits from Denmark, but I'm not sure what to read into that. But anyway, this is the penultimate, and (it could be, we'll see how it pans out) the best of the four. Michelles and Obamas, My Ace Hen's 2010 Serialized Photoplays. I'm gonna limit my list to shows that debuted in 2010, and&lt;i&gt; Boardwalk Empire &lt;/i&gt;and&lt;i&gt; Panty and Stocking with Garterbelt&lt;/i&gt; aren't on here because I haven't watched it. This will be two separate posts anyway, one for TV (this one), and the next one for the movies. DON'T TOUCH THAT SET.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEST TELEVISION SERIES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Hardy Bucks (RTE)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This one gets in mostly because I kind of skipped over the whole batch of new shows that came in this year. I mostly just caught up on new cartoons, and as a result 3 of the 5 shows on this list are animated. But hey, the actual review. There isn't a whole lot to say about this, since I can't really describe it. Irish &lt;i&gt;Trailer Park Boys&lt;/i&gt; maybe? You can probably watch the whole thing on youtube anyway, since RTE really dropped the ball with this one, like they always do with a good show. It's not up there with &lt;i&gt;The Modest Adventures of David O'Doherty&lt;/i&gt;, but it sure beats Katharine Lynch or the fucking Panel.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Regular Show (Cartoon Network)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another show that it's hard to write about at length. Cartoon Network actually redeemed themselves a lot with their new batch of shows. Between this and Sym-Bionic Titan and my number one new show of the year, they've got a great line-up of new shows. There's a new Ben10 thing too, but I don't really care about that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, Regular Show is a "sitcom" done by J.G. Quintel, who worked on &lt;i&gt;The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack&lt;/i&gt; which is a pretty awesome show in itself, although it was screwed by the network pretty hard. It's also got Mark Hamill voicing a yeti, and is about two 23-year old slackers, a raccoon, and a blue jay, pretty much just fucking shit up. It doesn't sound great on paper, but heck is it funny. It's got a nice style to it too, as well as a kick-ass soundtrack. It's already in Season 2, but I mean there wasn't even a break between seasons 1 and 2, so it's questionable whether you should divide them. But hey, you should watch it. HMM-MMM-HMM&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic (The Hub)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I feel weird putting this at number 3, and admittedly it might only be getting such a high placing because it exceeded my expectations, which they were higher for the new Weezer album than for this, but, to use my catchphrase with some self-awareness, IT'S SOOOOO GUD. I don't know a damn thing about My Little Pony other than the shows used to be the worst thing on TV outside of Mr. Blobby, but goddamn.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Anyway, in another extension of the mid-'00s Cartoon Network talent tree, this show is run by Lauren Faust, who worked on &lt;i&gt;PowerPuff Girls &lt;/i&gt;and &lt;i&gt;Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends&lt;/i&gt;. Although the show has a pretty nice art style, it really survives on the strength of its writing, and also an impressively well-rounded cast of characters. You can watch the entire thing at &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/pensivepony"&gt;http://www.youtube.com/pensivepony&lt;/a&gt; although their account has been taken down once before, but I'll edit this post as it moves around. Also the first episode is a 2-parter, and although it's pretty good, and establishes a nice, epic mythology, along with hammering in the theme of the show (FRIENDSHIP IS TOTALLY GREAT, WOW. Yeah the show tends to drive it's Aesop home in the last minute of a show, and although it's way ahead of the curve for quality of such things, it still grates occasionally), but it's not really representative of the show as a whole, which is more a light comedy than a dark adventure story. But whatevz, check this sweet shit out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. The Walking Dead (AMC)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Frank Darabont runs a sweet show about some dudes going across the U.S. of A. after a zombie apocalypse. It's got awesome visuals and dodgy accents, so check this shit out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Adventure Time with Finn &amp;amp; Jake&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;(Cartoon Network)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh fuck this show is amazing. Some dude on tvtropes described it pretty well: it's just a pretty fantastical D&amp;amp;D campaign. Basically, the theme song describes the show pretty well:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;Adventure Time, &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;come on grab your friends&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;we'll go to very distant lands,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;with Jake the Dog,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;and Finn the Human,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;the fun will never end,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;it's Adventure Time!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So it's about a shapeshifting dog who has a Bill Murray thing going on, a fervently LAWFUL GOOD 12-year old boy, with an awesome hat, adventuring across the post-apocalyptic continent of Ooo. There's also the most sympathetic kidnapper ever, the Ice King, who just oh man he is just so sad. The supporting cast is great too, there's Marceline the Vampire Queen, Princess Bubblegum, Lumpy Space Princess, everyone else. It's beautifully drawn, and has some kick-ass songs to boot (outside of the theme tune, my favourite is probably &lt;i&gt;There Go Our Boys, &lt;/i&gt;which man it is catchy. OH MARCELIIIIIINE, WHY ARE YOU SO MEAN?) and is probably the only case in human history where Rule 63 was invoked without being creepy. This show is funny, moving, exciting, and, at times, kind of disturbing ("I'm your guardian angel, Finn": nightmares, man). I'm pretty sure it's on iTunes if you're into paying for things, if not you can probably find it on the internet somewhere, although that might take a while, and if that fails, just ask me for the episodes of this insanely baller piece of work.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;HONOURABLE MENTION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Louie&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Children's Hospital&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEST CONTINUING SERIES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Venture Bros.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Mad Men&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;BEST CLUSTERFUCK&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Happy Town&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;MOST PRETENTIOUS PIECE OF SHIT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gravity&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;THE SHOW I WILL MISS THE MOST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Party Down&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But that's about it, again, if there are any new shows I missed or whatever, tell me about them.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And I am into it,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/2010-serialized-photoplays.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4431802399776690362'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4431802399776690362'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-1218712533662338434</id><published>2010-12-30T16:32:00.005Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.269+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>2010: The Musics</title><content type='html'>Between watching My Little Pony, looking at palaeontology notes, and playing Democracy 2 (I swear I'm somehow getting worse at it), it's taken me until now to realise that I have 3 2010-in-review posts (music, films, tv) to get done in less than 2 days. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So fuck it, even though nobody read the last time I did several posts in a day (the result of a late caffeine-fuelled conversation with Darver, which I paid for heavily the next day), y'all gonna get more My Ace Hen than you will ever want. So, music, yeah. I listened to a fair few 2010 albums this year, and so far only one I'm looking forward to is still untouched (Panty Stocking OST), and I have a handful of 2010 albums on my laptop but none were quite good enough to make the list, so I'm just gonna skip them altogether.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So, without further delay, My Ace Hen's Top 5 Objectively Good Albums of 2010 and Also the Albums That Sucked Really Fucking Hard and You Should Feel Bad for Liking Them&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Bob Dylan - The Bootleg Series Volume 9 (Columbia)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I actually deliberated for a while over what would take the fifth spot on this list, but then I remembered the Witmark Demos were officially released this year, remastered and all, and I couldn't put anything else here. I don't actually have the official version, rather I'm reviewing the old ass bootleg put out by Capricorn. Basically this release is Dylan's early demos for his first 2 publishing companies, Leeds and Witmark. There are a lot of familiar songs here, &lt;i&gt;Hard Rain, Mr. Tambourine Man,&lt;/i&gt; et cetera. It's also got another version of &lt;i&gt;Tomorrow is a Long Time&lt;/i&gt;, which is my favourite Dylan song of all. It's a beautiful collection indeed, and you can get with it a live concert he did at Brandeis university around the same time. But people kind of zone out when I start talking about Dylan, so just buy/download the thing or whatever it is you do when you want new music, this shit be worth it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Broken Social Scene - Forgiveness Rock Record (Arts &amp;amp; Crafts)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This was the one that took me most by surprise. I'd only listened to a bit of Broken Social Scene before I heard this, and I thought it was pretty good yeah, but I never got around to listening to each album and E.P. through from start to finish. But regardless, I downloaded this and gave it a spin, to celebrate the start of my summer (I downloaded it the day my exams finished, if I recall correctly) and I was blown away. The first song. &lt;i&gt;World Sick, &lt;/i&gt;was fucking phenomenal, and it only got better from there. &lt;i&gt;Forced to Love, Art House Director, Sentimental Xs, Water in Hell, Texico Bitches,&lt;/i&gt; this album is packed with classics. I mean I can't really do them in justice in a short paragraph or two, so just cop this ish, as it is off the fucking chain.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross - The Social Network (The Null Corporation)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One of the best fucking films of the year, with one of the best soundtracks. Aaron Sorkin, David Fincher, and Trent Reznor teaming up for an trifecta of totally terrifyingly terrific. I can't write a whole lot about it, but this is a fucking beautiful piece of work. It's got kick-ass tracks like &lt;i&gt;Hand Covers Bruise&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;In Motion, &lt;/i&gt;but it's also got the best rendition of &lt;i&gt;In the Hall of the Mountain King&lt;/i&gt; I've ever heard (incidentally, it was one of the first classical pieces I ever heard). It's also further proof that Reznor needs to ditch the Nine Inch Nails shit and focus more on being one of the best composers and musicians of the last 30 years.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Das Racist - Sit Down, Man (МИШКА)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was pretty skeptical about Das Racist at the start of this year. All I knew about them was that fucking song, &lt;i&gt;Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, &lt;/i&gt;which is just fucking awful. But then, positive news! They got some great producers on board and El-P was giving them praise, and then I played the video for &lt;i&gt;Who's That, Brooown? &lt;/i&gt;and I was suddenly really excited. It then took me a while for a good quality link to come up, and so I gave it a listen.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Unlike some of the other rap albums I had listened to up to that point (I slept on the ones from Rhymefest and Clipse, who I really liked a few years ago) (I'm looking in your direction Eminem and Jay-Z), this one was fucking immense. I mean I thought &lt;i&gt;Shut Up, Dude&lt;/i&gt; was good, it had &lt;i&gt;You Oughta Know&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;Rainbow in the Dark&lt;/i&gt; and a few other quality tracks, but this one just blew me away. Unlike with Jay Electronica, who when he started getting attention got me really hyped up, but then spent pretty much all of 2010 letting me down, Das Racist just exceeded my expectations, while at the same time continually raising the bar. The rapping is immense, and the beats are phenomenal, and I find something new every time I listen to it. It's also got that beautiful rarity, the El-P guest verse, and that alone would make it worth a cop, but seriously, fucking amazing, get this shit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Emancipator - Safe in the Steep Cliffs (Emancipator Music)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Emancipator is this dude in his early 20s called Douglas Appling who plays most of the instruments on this entirely instrumental album. His first, Soon It Will Be Cold Enough to Build Fires, was really fucking good, and had a beautiful guest vocal from someone whose name I don't know on&lt;i&gt; When I Go&lt;/i&gt;, but the only problem I had with it was I felt the drums were weak. Well it's like Emancipator was reading my mind, because this one fixed that, and is near perfect.

I mean I'll still ascribe arbitrary numerical values to their quality and all, but only my top ones will get any inches, plus I'll write about Pinkerton and Funcrusher Plus, two awesome albums that were reissued this year. But yeah, this one is all about the vidya, and all mentioned here are either on the ps3 or PC, since although I did briefly play a Dreamcast this year, I don't really want to talk about my failures as a roller coaster tycoon. Also I'll rag on Ubisoft a bit for a couple of reasons. In brackets be the console I experienced that particular vidya on.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;TOP 5 GAMES OF 2010&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;5. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX (PS3)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I heard about this one somehow, and at first I was a bit skeptical. "Pac-Man?", I said, sure I can play that on Google. But hey, I thought, maybe I should give it a go, I mean once a classic, always a classic (Shakespeare in Love excepted, what did dudes see in that way back when?), right? So yeah I downloaded the demo and well HOLY FUCKBALLS THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER I thought. Sure enough it went on sale around Christmas, and I bought the full version on PSN. IT IS SOMEHOW EVEN BETTER HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE I thought. I mean it wouldn't be really interesting to go into what the game actually has, it basically manages to be History of Pac-Man somehow, and has got mad modes and mazes and graphical mods and music. But I think Fortenbro said it better than I could on his twitter:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;"OH GOD I'M TRIPPING BALLS FUCKING PAC MAN CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION DX"&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;4. Yakuza 3 (PS3)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This game/series wasn't on my radar at all going into 2010, but then slowly momentum started to build. Places like 1up were creaming topical like cortisone about it, and Fortengard was talking about how baller it was. I still wasn't planning on getting it any time soon, but then HMV had it on sale for an absolutely great €20. I picked that shit up and ended up playing this awesome beat-'em-up/RPG hybrid about a yakuza who now runs an orphanage! Some of his orphans bugged me at first, but damn this game develops its characters. Even that massive dick Mine was humanized by the end. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It also features mad side-quests, like taking creepy chicks out on dates (they ALL text you I LOVE YOU after like one fucking day, what the fuck man?), playing golf with a local politician, playing baseball to teach a prima donna former star a lesson, playing some old Sega games, and what was probably my favourite part, the blogging sidequest, where some complete weeaboo American dude shows you how to learn new moves through the awesome power of blogging. CAN YOU RELATE?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;3. Sly Trilogy (PS3)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is part of Sony's newfangled CLASSICS HD line, where PS2 games are given a spit-shine and reissued, lemony fresh, into the modern world. Although you could cynically dismiss it, given Sony's removal of PS2 backward compatibility from later editions of the PS3, it's still pretty sweet to have an awesome collection of games on one disc. That they don't retail for full price helps too. So far they've put out the God of War collection and the Sly Trilogy, and I think next year they're putting out a Team Ico collection, presumably to drum up excitement for The Last Guardian (which oh fuck how baller will that be?).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But yeah, Sly Cooper was this awesome crazy fun series of platformers back in the halcyon PS2 days, and it was kind of lumped in with the titans of PS2 platforming, Jak &amp;amp; Daxter, and Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank (they had the same devs as Crash and Spyro on the PS1 respectively. When the new devs showed up for those franchises, man did they start to stink quick. See: Enter the Dragonfly) but it didn't really have the same sales as they did, so it kind of faded from memory it seems.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's back, though, and it's KICKING ASS. It has some Move support, but since I don't have Move I can't comment. The main feature is dem HD graphics. Although the cutscenes still take place in SD, the actual action looks damned beautiful. That's all there really is to it, the gameplay's still the same, and the dialogue is still kind of awkward (characters are pretty much always referred to by their full name, e.g. Agent Carmelita Fox, even though the characters should be familiar enough with her that Agent Fox or Fox or Carmelita would do), but hey, overall it's pretty gully.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. Super Meat Boy (PC)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Of the four games on this list that have an ending, Super Meat Boy is the one where I'm furthest away (I've finished Yakuza 3 and the next game on the list I'm not naming yet, SUSPENSE) but holy fuck what I've played is great. It's a 2d platformer with 100s of levels, but each one has a unique aspect, and the game is fucking hard too. It's normally €13 on Steam, which I mean is a bit steep when you consider it was available for €3.50 during the Steam Christmas sale, and holy fuck it was a well spent three-and-a-half quid.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1. Civilization V (PC)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The motherfucking ownage game of the year. Fuck. This was the game I was really excited for going into this year, since like I'd been a Civ fan since I was 10 or something, and Civ IV was just such unbelievable ownage. A lot of people on CivFanatics were worried that it was going to be too much like Civ:Rev, that PS3 game which didn't have hotseat multiplayer even though it was ideal fuck. I mean there's not a whole lot to write about, it's classic Civ but better! Although I haven't figured out how to get geographically accurate starts yet, which kind of bugs me (Aztecs in Russia! Japan in Africa! China in China which was the only accurate one I saw in the course of my American game) but I mean it's still awesome. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was at one point going to write a long thing about how my nation developed, which is one of the awesome things about Civ. To put it short, I have dicey relations with Germany, I conquered the southern and eastern coasts of Africa and then sold them off to the highest bidder to fund a public education system and an expanded navy, Persia be hating on me for reasons I can't quite comprehend, and I have a booming economy, which is only rivalled by Germany to my north (I actually conquered whatever Greek cities they hadn't taken, and sold them off to Germany, which paid for some improvements to my northern cities, also: I, America, am in South America, and Germany is in North America) and I'm currently planning to invade Australia and establish some colonies there. The combat system is also mad improved, and it's a lot harder to win by simple brute force now, and also cities now have their own defence strength, which I cannot stress enough how vital this is for me. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also the game has this awesome art deco kind of style, and although it doesn't have Leonard Nimoy as the narrator and dude who reads out those excellent quotes you get when you build a wonder or research a new tech, it's Morgan Sheppard I think? And although his voice is good (and truly transcendent during the opening movie) I'm disappointed they didn't get Martin Sheen, because holy fuck that would have been amazing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;HONORABLE MENTION: COSTUME QUEST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I think I've actually ragged on Brutal Legend quite a bit in previous posts, but allow me to re-iterate: Shit sucked, dude. After it, I had little hope for Double Fine's future. The outlook was bleak. Spring was not to come.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;BUT THEN, THQ stepped in and was all "Yo, we dig yo shit" and signed a deal with Double Fine to put out small, short games on XBLA and PSN, and I was all FUCK YES.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The first game to result from this partnership is Costume Quest, a hallowe'en themed RPG, where one can take on powers relating to their costume. This is a pretty sweet concept, and they don't skimp on the costumes either. There's a whole variety: from Space Ranger to Unicorn, and many of them have their own special abilities while you're exploring the overworld. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It's already got it's first expansion (the winter/christmas-themed Grubbins on Ice) and it's a pretty sweet RPG if you're into that sort of thing. The combat's simple, and you don't have any items to use (it can be a bit frustrating), and you fully heal after every battle, which is mad useful. It's also got some excellent style, and is just flat out nice to look at, plus hilarious to boot. It's €11.25 on the PSN (not sure how many MS Points it costs) and the expansion's an extra 3 or 4, so if you have some money lying around, you should pick up one of those Credit packs and buy it, cos it's some good vidya.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;OTHER GAMES I PLAYED AND ENJOYED BUT THEY FAILED TO MAKE THE CUT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Red Dead Redemption&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Skate 3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;NBA 2K11&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Joe Danger&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gran Turismo 5&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;FIFA 11&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 11&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Minecraft&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Super Mario Bros.

I'm in the last 10 days of the year anyway, and although I haven't posted recently, that will all change since there will be a veritable rockalanche of posts about all kinds of shit, like a general social 2010 one, one about albums I really dug, one about films I saw and TV I watched, and so on. I might even get really annoying and post a My Year in Status thing up in, just to piss y'all off. Row row fight tha powah. But first off is a brief post about what I got up to in the 12 weeks of my first semester in blah blah blah. I'm kind of struggling writing long things thanks to the mindstate my geography essay has put me in (the first 100 words were a goddamned struggle that took far longer than 100 words ever should) but hopefully I can touch on all the major Mr. X happenings.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Well, first off, just to get it out of the way, the only reason I was even going into second year was because I had done alright on my supplemental exams, I'd even improved my Geography I mark by 250%, which I was mad chuffed with, and I did way better than I expected in my 2 chemistry exams, which I did pretty badly on in May, where I got 57% in both cases, which fuck yeah exceeding expectations (I honestly thought, after I came out from them, that I'd be lucky to get 40%, and would need compensation to pass the year (compensation is a practice in Trinity whereby you can fail 10 credits worth of exams and still pass the year, provided that a) you get 35% in the exam you failed and b) your average is 40% or higher)). But hey, it meant I had 2 weeks off until Semester 1 started (I used this time to start watching The West Wing, an amazing show I might blog about later) and also it turned out Larney was going into 2nd year too, which meant the glorious Bropad was go in Shanowen Square. It turned out we got a flat on the ground floor of a block right beside the gate, which too sweet. But on to the semester itself.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;1) NEW DUDES&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The main thing in any review post has to be NEW DUDES, basically dudes you met in the timeframe the post covered who are worthy of inclusion in this completely awesome blog, (which I can say definitively is the Best Blog in Cooley, and also the #1 Blog in Cooley.) so of course the obvious dudes are the two Connaught dudes currently living with me and Larney: Domhnaill and Simon (I ain't know their last names), who are both really sound dudes. I should mention I lost some money to Simon hustling hoops on NBA Live 2001 (once there was money at stake, Simon suddenly stopped shooting 40 3s a game, and was thus whupping my ass with his superior board play, but I also lost on a shitty shot for Nowitzki with 5 seconds to go, because this was back in 2000 before the Mavs were fucking awesome and Nash was a 2-time MVP) and Domhnaill generally being a legend. It was fun times gan dabht. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I met some cool dudes in my course too, but I mean what I can say is limited because I actually knew them beforehand, so yeah. Also my attendance record could have been better, although I only missed one lab, I did miss a handful of lectures, and something like a third of them in geography, which basically means that there is a small part of geography and a similar-sized chunk of chemistry I have no notes for (the lectures I missed happened to be given by the old-school No Notes Online types, shitsux)  but thankfully I have excellent notes on the rest of the course in both cases, so it's all sound.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Last dudes to get a mention are the handful of dudes I met because Larney holds parties like every 2nd week almost (they're pretty good parties, and unlike last year, the noise is pretty reasonable, plus the lack of Massey the Buzz Killing Security Guard, Although He's Pretty Cool Generally, means that they're overall better) but shouts out to the dudes I saw the most, Kerrie (who actually got a post here earlier, mainly because she wrote a nice thing on my whiteboard, which I subsequently erased so I could plot galactic domination in Battlefront II, which more on that later) and Conor and Ruairi and Doireann and Andrew, who were all pretty cool, but also Aidan (Aiden?), who's kind of like Kevin's child is a good way of describing it, who even though he's a Maynooth student habitually spends a couple of days at a time up here. At one point he was there for pretty much the entire week, the blizzard week, where I walked home from college which wasn't fun, and Larney went outside in inches-deep snow in flip-flops and shorts, and was pretty much dead the next morning.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;2) TRASH-TALKING&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is an art I've become pretty fucking good at thanks to the Playstation we have up in. I routinely beat dudes in games as varied as SSX 3, NBA Live, and Crash Team Racing, and also Battlefront II, and these easy victories over a bunch of jive turkeys allows me to trash talk liberally. At one point it got Simon very frustrated, but then he turned around and honed his own trash-talking game, so now it's pretty fun, and with SSX 3 and Domhnaill's dominance of Ruthless Ridge and Snow Jam, even he's gotten in on it. Trash talking is actually another fun part of couch multiplayer (see: Multitap, Obsolted in the archives) and it was actually fantastic. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also since this is effectively a section about games that were done played now: Battlefront II, a recent addition to recreation in our flat. I got a lend of it off my friend Sean, who I've known since literally the day I was born, and brought it up, to play some mad Galactic Conquests up in with Larney. We're playing the Prequels Galactic Conquest, I'm the Seps, he's the Republic, and things are pretty exciting. Generally one of us will go on a 3- or 4-battle winning streak, and the map will change completely, then slowly things will return to the status quo, which is basically an 8:4 split of the galaxy, with Larney completely controlling the Northeastern quadrant, and me controlling everything else. A full recap of the events so far, retold in KDP style form will be related in a later post.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also played was CTR, which thanks to the awesome multitap, was pretty popular. Kerrie's notorious game has been touched upon in her post, but she wasn't the worst, and she actually came 2nd a couple of times. Generally the whole thing had no established hierarchy, and the whole anyone-can-win-except-Kerrie thing really contributed to the crazy fun.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;3) GENERAL ABSURDITY&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So the final section of this blog is just gonna be brief descriptions of odd things that went down during the year.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Firstly I need to mention something I've heard mentioned in whispers on the Trinners section of boards.ie. Apparently in JF Science, some chick had an episode while campaigning for class rep, and her mom showed up and there were tears and vomiting. Emma wasn't able to yield any additional info, and since she's the only person I know in JF Science (well apart from Geenry, but I never see that dude) it's a dead end.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There were a number of things, some of them was shit I didn't witness, and thus it became cooler by way of mystery, such as the Heino keg which is now a table in our living room, and the threads connecting all three lights in the kitchen.  Then there was outright bizarre shit, like someone throwing a snowman into our living room, and the sudden appearance of a miniature pool, which was re-purposed as a kind of open-air fridge.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There was also the discovery of ADVENTURE TIME, a fucking awesome cartoon about Jake the Dog and Finn the Human. The fun will never end, it's Adventure Time. Which we watched a lot of (along with Regular Show, about two 23-year-old slackers who are a blue jay and a raccoon) and it's alright become part of my everyday conversation with Larney. Finn's hat, and an appropriate piece of Jake clothing have been found on Hot Topic, so next time costuming up is called for, we are going to be Finn and Jake. It's a really fucking good show anyway (IT'S SO GOOD I would say, as apparently that is now my catchphrase) and you should watch it as soon as possible.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That's about it for the Semester 1 review, which I probably missed out on some sizable shit but I covered all the major bases, so enjoy, and learn more about me. I'll be doing some 2010 review and 2011 preview posts over the next week or so anyway, so stay tuned! And to all the dudes (Frank, Ri, Emma) who didn't get mentioned, it was 'cos I already knew you, but y'all alright by me anyway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;IT'S SO GOOD,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/review-of-my-first-semester-in-my.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2367862537577790765'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2367862537577790765'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-700532221519895667</id><published>2010-12-08T02:10:00.004Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.301+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Video games'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Notions'/><title type='text'>An RPG which attempts to create an epic story from various hip-hop related ingredients</title><content type='html'>So a couple days back I was talking on msn with my bro Fortengard (I've mentioned his blog before, which you can check out for sweet posts on various things that mostly originate in Japan (perhaps entirely, but I'm in Writer and I'm not going to check)) and he told me he had this baller idea, which I'm not going to recount, but it was pretty awesome. Impressed, and slightly jelly, I decided to come up with my own idea for a video game, and so after a really short brainstorm, I improvised an idea for an action-rpg that would be to hip-hop what Brutal Legend was to heavy metal.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Up front, I've never actually finished Brutal Legend, and it's a game that I just did not enjoy. One thing it did right however, was the mythology. Weaving icons of a genre that has always had acts fascinated with grand creatures, who are often massive dicks (there's Christian Metal too, but apart from UnderOath and this one song from a band Conservapedia was briefly really excited about, I don't know shit about it) and Brutal Legend fitted that in well. It also had stuff like the Headbanger armies, which poked gentle fun at stereotypes, and overall it was a really affectionate thing.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The main reason I thought this hip-hop RPG would be a good idea though, is the four elements. I'd been playing Barkley, Shut Up and Jam: Gaiden when I first came up with this idea actually (BSUAJ:G managed to make an epic story that was both hilarious and gripping, and featured some innovated hoops-based combat), but apart from the MCing element (which I cribbed the mechanism entirely from Deltron 3030, or at least my understanding of Deltron 3030) I couldn't figure out any possible mechanisms for the other 3 elements, although in theory they make a sweet, pyrokinetic magic combat system.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have a bunch of ideas for the story anyway, and on MSN we spent most of the conversation talking about where various rappers would fit in, although really I don't plan on using actual rappers as characters, although pretty much I've slotted in Jay Electronica as the player character, KRS-One as the mentor, and Brother Ali as the healer. Other than that, I'm still working out what direction to go with it, even though like 5 years from now, when it's done, Interscope probably won't even be releasing rap music. But hey, maybe can I get in on some nostalgia market with that, and get Rhymefest to endorse it and everything.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This probably sounds corny as hell, but I think I could make something good with it, y'know? But the main thing is figuring out and ordering all my ideas into a neat, engaging story. This post would be longer if I posted every idea I had relating to this in this post, but then we'd be here all day, and even less people would understand it than usual.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But hey,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/rpg-which-attempts-to-create-epic-story.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/700532221519895667'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/700532221519895667'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-1808732519956655985</id><published>2010-12-05T23:12:00.005Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:51.272+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Bros'/><title type='text'>Kerrie Explains It All</title><content type='html'>Right so this is gonna diverge from what has been the defining genre of post for Season 2 of My Ace Hen (basically seasons is an idea I've discussed with Frank, basically the blog runs for 5 months, then has 3 months off, then another season of 4 months, in every annual cycle) which is long posts about obscure things the readers don't care about. Basically there's this person who basically lives here, Kerrie, who's in Kevin's engineering class (her breadboard is here and shit) along with the rest of the Engineering Cadre who are here often, to play CTR and set Kevin's homepage to porn. But yeah, Kerrie saw me blogging one time and asked to do a post for her, so basically I'm gonna post a short list of facts about Kerrie.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Her mom is a total wingman (wingwoman? or is it like Officer, with wingman not denoting gender?) but the most important thing is Kerrie's notoriously bad CTR game. I actually had a list of facts about Kerrie I typed up at Social Gunpoint, but posting them on a blog people I don't know read is not rad. But back to Kerrie's CTR game, a game so bad that a dog raises its hackles if it is approached by Kerrie's game. Her game stinks so bad families in cars roll up the windows. If her game touches some eggs the mother bird will kill said eggs. Should wear a leather mask and race Polar Pass in the travelling circus sideshow, everyone hey look at this terrible game. Apparently she came 2nd a few times or something recently, but I'll believe it when I see it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, this is not a complete representation of Kerrie. See, although her game is notoriously bad, one is rarely defined by one's game (unless you're Sam Bowie or something, in which case your life is defined by the inferiority of your game when compared to Michael Jordan, although I mean the Blazers had to pick Bowie. They'd drafted Drexler the previous year, and drafting Jordan would just have been a complete waste, whereas Bowie addressed a need, and it wasn't like he was on Olowakandi levels of suck), but Kerrie is, in fact, pretty awesome. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She's actually one of the two people who actually cleans our flat at all ever, which that someone actually cleans a place that isn't theirs says a lot for how bad things get around here, and although she sometimes does un-rad things, like getting a dude to shave his beard (NOT COOL) she is mostly up on the level, all writing nice things on my whiteboard, and ordering pizza, and generally being pretty cool. I suck at these people posts, but yeah, Kerrie is a bro, like a true bro.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm not sure what exactly I can write here, other than just re-assert my previous point, I mean it's pretty hard to quantify or articulate the bro quality, it's intangible and defies definition, nawmean? But she's got said B.Q., and although Larney is the only reader who knows who she is, she gets this post anyway, as small payment for all the cleaning out the sink times.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;WORD,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/kerrie-explains-it-all.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1808732519956655985'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1808732519956655985'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-711470210457623627</id><published>2010-12-04T17:44:00.013Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.751+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Television'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>A long, winding post on Avatar: The Last Airbender</title><content type='html'>&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;So it's b&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;een a while sin&lt;/span&gt;ce I've done a long, pointless post, since I've had less free time for various reasons; being awesome, working on my geography and chemistry projects, and also time I've set aside for polishing my lab books but never using said time efficiently, and lastly reading through the entirety of Hark! a Vagrant, which is an absolutely hilarious history-inspired comic for the most part, with absolutely great strips about Teddy Roosevelt and Napoleon and shit. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;But like the thing that took up the most time last week was Avatar: The Last Airbender, this cartoon that ran for 3 seasons (or "books") from 2005 to 2008 on Nickelodeon, which I downloaded because of repeated recommendations from /co/ (next up from /co/: My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic... no, seriously) and I pretty much just sped through it, starting it late Sunday night and finishing it mid-afternoon on Thursday. It's still pretty fresh up in my noggin so I figured I'd write a long thing (inspired mostly by the series of recaps over at Fortengard Custom, link can be found in my blogroll) that won't be a straight-up recap, but more what I think of the show, and just things I noticed, along with an appraisal of everything. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;So, in short, prepare your anuses for My Ace Hen's Impressions and Thoughts Regarding the Animated Serial, Avatar; concering the adventures and journey of the Last Airbender. I need to start somewhere, and considering the scope of the show, the opening narration does a pretty good job of explaining it, so I'll just post that as an introduction.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Avatar_world_map.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 331px; height: 225px;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/39/Avatar_world_map.jpg" border="0" alt="" /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; text-align: center; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;A map of the world in Avatar, with some pretty obvious colour-coding.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: 20px; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Water... Earth... Fire... Air. Long ago, the 4 nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar, master of all 4 elements, could stop them, but when the world needed him most, he vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he still has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe Aang can save the world."&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Basically, what it said. There are four elements, each representing a both a peoples and a martial art (or "bending", for obvious reasons, the show was subtitled The Legend of Aang over here) that can be linked to an Asian nation and martial art. Like, the Earth Kingdom is China, the Fire Nation is Japan, and the Water Tribe are the Inuits. You won't need 2 guesses for who the Air Nomads are inspired by. Also, e&lt;/span&gt;ach of the three seasons deals primarily with a form Aang has to learn (Book 1 = Water, Book 2 = Earth, Book 3 = Fire). &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;The opening narration is slightly different for the first episode, as Aang has not yet been discovered, and the show opens with the narrator (a Waterbender named Katara) and her brother (a sarcastic warrior dude named Sokka) are going fishing, and they come across an iceberg. They find Aang, but they also alert an exiled Fire Nation prince, Zuko (who believes that finding the long-lost Avatar will restore his HONOUR, a word you will hear him say a couple of hundred times over the course of the show), and his badass, tea-loving uncle, Iroh (Iroh drank coffee in the movie for some fucking absurd reason, but in terms of why the Last Airbender movie sucked, I mean it's just typical of why, minor pointless changes that destroy characters) are alerted to the Avatar's presence. Zuko shows up at Katara and Sokka's village at the South Pole, threats are made, action unfolds, and Aang, Katara, and Sokka take off to basically save the world. That's all you need to know in terms of the plot, I mean I really don't want to spoil anything, but now I'm gonna spend the rest of the post talking, in brief, about why I think this show is awesome, and is in my top ten shows of the 00s. (In no particular order, they are: The West Wing; Avatar: The Last Airbender; The Wire; Futurama; Arrested Development; FLCL; Mad Men; Firefly; How I Met Your Mother; Deadwood)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Obviously, talking about a cartoon, the first thing I need to touch on is the art style and animation, which I think are tout-sweet. The world is just beautiful to look at, and even the ridiculous things, like the X-Y zoo they got going on in Avatarworld, are awesome (fuck yeah Appa) and the characters are well designed, and distinctive&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TPqhWvdWt-I/AAAAAAAAAEk/PcaEaBKAc9I/s1600/Art%2Bexample.jpg"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 200px; height: 150px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TPqhWvdWt-I/AAAAAAAAAEk/PcaEaBKAc9I/s200/Art%2Bexample.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5546923303128971234" /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt; text-align:center;line-height:normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;i&gt;Actually this is a really good example, and it’s limited to characters from the first two episodes, and is thus spoiler free.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;i&gt; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Suffice to say it's basically Western Anime, it looks extremely good, but some idiots continuously confuse it for an actual Japanese animation, which dear God son, you that dumb (Spoony did this, if I recall correctly).&lt;span&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;Another great thing is the show’s fight choreography, which is on par with some of the great wushu films of whenever. Each bending discipline is just an actual martial art with some effects basically (e.g., Water Bending = Tai Chi Chuan, Fire Bending = Kung fu) and the fights are just high on the Holy Shit Quotient. There’s also a Pro Wrestling thing with the Earthbenders in season 2, with a very affectionate parody of The Rock, voiced by Mick Foley, and it’s pretty hilarious. I mean I don't know that much about animation, so I can't write at length about it, and thankfully THE BOULDER allows me to segue into the next part of the post, about the characters and writing.&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;Honestly, the characters are the best thing about this great show. The main characters are all well-rounded, and have very good arcs, and develop nicely, although they retain their key characteristics (i.e., Aang is playful, Sokka is sarcastic, Zuko is obsessed with HONOUR!) and the minor characters, like Suki, and Jet, fit in seamlessly, and are generally awesome. I mean if I were to count the list of awesome, well-rounded characters, it would be in the high double digits. Most episodes of the first season, for example, introduce 1 or 2 great characters. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal"&gt;It even introduces a new character in season 2, and while many shows pretty much fall apart when they change the central dynamic, Avatar's characters are strong enough that the show continues its rise with a party of four instead of three, and when they bring all the cast back (for the most part) in season 3, it doesn't feel like horrible fanservice, like it often does. (Hey, it's characters who have no reason to be here, but they're  here because they have a massive shipping community, etc.) although that's not to say Avatar doesn't have a massive and sometimes annoying shipping community (I'm looking at y'all, Zutarians, y'all why we can't have nice things) but even the romantic parts of the show have a feeling that the happy ending (lame pun, sorry) has been earned, which is always great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height: normal"&gt;&lt;span&gt;The last thing to talk about, given that I've touched on the animation/fight choreography and the characters/writing, is the voice acting and music. It's got a kickass voice cast, including Mae Whitman (Arrested Development, Scott Pilgrim vs. the World), Mako (pretty much everything ever) and Mark Hamill (most iconic villains from 90s animations. He adds another leaf to that cap here with Fire Lord Ozai). The music is also fucking incredible, it's done by this duo called The Track Team, and you can get an unofficial version on Mediafire (I deleted my mp3 blog, Running Dog, for a reason, so hit me up on some kind of IM protocol if you want a link), and it fits with the world perfectly. It's also got some pretty nice folk standards up in also (Leaves from the Vine, damn that's some sad shit man, manly tears were shed for the dude singing it, and also for Mako, who died before the season was completed).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;The deal-clincher for this show is it's universe though. Damn that's some immersive, brilliant world-building. I already discussed the Nations and how they were inspired by different Asian peoples up in the second paragraph, but beyond that, it's a seriously good universe, I mean there needs to be an Avatar version of King of Dragon Pass (for me, whether or not a fictional epic-fantasy universe could work with King of Dragon Pass gameplay is one way of determining how good it is, e.g., Lord of the Rings and Avatar pass, Harry Potter fails miserably).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;I'm not sure what else I can write about this awesome show, so all I can do is encourage you to watch it, hit me up and I'll give you a link for the first episode so you can check it out, but it's definitely something you should do at some point.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;I fucked the moon,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: 0.0001pt; line-height: normal; "&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span"&gt;Cathal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/12/i-fucked-moon-long-winding-post-on.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/711470210457623627'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/711470210457623627'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TPqhWvdWt-I/AAAAAAAAAEk/PcaEaBKAc9I/s72-c/Art%2Bexample.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-5832882192015178947</id><published>2010-12-01T22:51:00.002Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.744+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Fiction'/><title type='text'>An unfinished parable</title><content type='html'>One day there was a man walking about a town, when he saw someone partaking in a forbidden drug.

It's going to have all the elements of an awesome One Good Cop movie (with spy movie elements), and some interesting historical factoids. For example, the film will open with Stanton in the courtroom, invoking the insanity defence for Daniel E. Sickles, one of the first instances of the insanity defence ever! It'll also be embellished a bit, and the Confederates will be kind of like the Russians in spy movies of the day, and it will also include a rousing early speech (establishing Stanton as a man of the pen, as well as a man of the sword) where Stanton convinces Buchanan to declare secession unconstitutional.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then the film will have scenes of Stanton helping out an inept cop in fighting a massive conspiracy. Then the dude he's helping gets fired for sucking so much, and Stanton's all "I'm only doing this to save my country", so then he sees the Confederates, and he's all &lt;b&gt;ENOUGH O' THIS!&lt;/b&gt; And then he's all busting generals with Union sympathies and being badass (I repeat that this is entirely an idea of fiction, there is nothing rad about abusing your power to ensure a verdict in a court-martial, or any shit like that. Democracies don't play that, democracies never been 'bout dat.) But then Lincoln gets assassinated (before this happens, Lincoln gives him a "writing cheques your body can't cash" sort of speech) and Stanton has a character building moment at his funeral. Then Andrew Johnson shows up and is being all soft on the Confederates Stanton fought so hard, and it's all about Stanton clashing with Johnson, until Johnson tries to fire Stanton, but Stanton is so popular among the citizenry that they rise up and impeach Johnson before he can do that.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TOwJf9T6qpI/AAAAAAAAAEM/M4SB8QUvey0/s1600/Edwin%2BMcMasters%2BStanton.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 225px; height: 286px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TOwJf9T6qpI/AAAAAAAAAEM/M4SB8QUvey0/s320/Edwin%2BMcMasters%2BStanton.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5542815686024931986" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;That is a pretty badass beard, one would have to admit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;I mean, again, work of fiction, but really Secretary of War is such a hardcore title, it's amazing there's never been a movie made with Harrison Ford or Kurt Russell with that title. I mean it's Air Force One and The West Wing-league "Awesome Titles for Movies and TV shows with Political Protagonists". Plus I could have all kinds of scenes, including scenes of strategic planning, which would be so gripping. I'll be developing this more, because there's just so much great material here, but yeah it'd just be damn good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;The tagline's going to be "I'll Tell You What I Know: He Can Save This Country".&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;Actually, scratch that.

The game itself is really cool, and every screen has hand-drawn art (with the exception of the village overview thing), and it's really well-written. A nifty thing this game does is save all the events in your clan's history into a text file. In lieu of a meaty post about Superman, or the PS1 I've set up in my flat, I'm going to post the history of my clan from 1329-1331. Also included is the ancient lore, which is presented to the player as a series of choices that determine gameplay conditions, like specialisation and attitude toward dragons.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Ancient Lore&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the marriage of Orlanth and Ernalda, our men whooped and drank with Orlanth, making Orlanth our main deity. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our clan’s earliest famous event was when Roitina, lady of dance, first performed the Clan-Making Dance. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During the Storm Age, we adopted strangers into our clan. Our worst enemies in those days were the trolls. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were originally a Balanced Clan. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At the Dawn, we first awakened Orlanth, the Father. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our attitude toward dragons and their ilk was neutral; we did not go along with them nor actively make war on them. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1329&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When we arrived in Dragon Pass, we claimed more land than we needed, to grow into. We built a clan hall, some steads, and a temple to Orlanth. But when we left Heortland, we lost much of our connection with the gods. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1330&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The alynx spirits chased off the vermin spirits; there would be few rats this year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Issaries priestess Sora Goodseller came to our clan and asked if we had any white horses to trade. We had no white horses. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We approached the Boskovi clan with an offer of peace. We offered them payment. They were pleased by our generosity, and we ended the feud. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Eonislara, betrothed to Jorator of the Elkenval clan, was seduced by Korol, the notorious troublemaking poet of the Heran clan. We told Jorator what had happened, but urged him to continue with the wedding. Jorator said that Eonislara was a fine young woman, and that if the gods condoned this behavior, he could do no less. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We approached the Hendart clan with an offer of peace. We offered them payment. They were pleased by our generosity, and we ended the feud. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We were raided by the horse nomads. Korlmar drove off a group of Horse-Spawn who were attempting to circle behind us. We drove the horse nomads off, and their survivors left without plundering our tula. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We approached the Hendart clan with an offer of peace. We proposed a reciprocal marriage between clans to seal our peace. The marriages were agreed to. Bride prices were exchanged for dowries. Twin feasts were held, in our hall and theirs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Inganna began the Storm Tribe heroquest. Inganna was told by Ernalda to make a tribe, so that she could challenge the Emperor. But the Doubting Wheel rolled up and told Inganna not to make a tribe. She said, “I will not be bad like the Emperor, for freedom is my essence.” “Freedom is your essence now,” the Wheel said, “but if you become like the Emperor in this way, soon you will be like him in every way.” She tried to roll the Doubting Wheel away. It rolled a long way away, until it arrived in the tula of the Fire Tribe, and there vexed the Emperor with its mockery and criticism. Inganna found Yinkin, who said he would join the tribe if Inganna could defeat the champions of the Plant Tribe. Inganna fought Sharp Green and let Yinkin fight Rustling Veins. Inganna blunted the many swords of Sharp Green, which gave it power. Yinkin defeated his foe, but said, “Your Storm Tribe will only be half useful. There is only half a chance that I will come to this confederation moot of yours.” Inganna found the Knowing God trapped inside a great cube. She told the Knowing God to launch a legal claim against the cube. “Why, in all my life, I have never heard anything so utterly moronic!” sputtered Lhankor Mhy. Then the cube crumbled, and the Knowing God was caught short for a moment. Then he Knew. “The creatures of the Stone Tribe think they understand everything. When they find something they cannot figure out, they fall apart.” Lhankor Mhy agreed to make the Marks On Bark Clan part of the Storm Tribe, so long as this new tribe had fierce warriors. Inganna found Vadrus, who had decided to fight Yinkin and his Cat Clan. Inganna said, “If we had a tribe, you could punish him without hurting him.” “This is a very strange thing you say,” Vadrus mused, “but perhaps it has a ring of truth to it. I will seek a new foe, and may even attend this confederation moot of yours — so long as my right to punish upstart Yinkin is made clear to all.” Inganna found more chieftains to bring their clans to the confederation moot, but when they got there, they fell to fighting, and blamed her for making contradictory promises. Inganna said, “With a tribe, we will be prosperous.” “How can we be prosperous if we can no longer raid our neighbors?” the chieftains asked. Inganna said, “With a tribe, our magic will be strong.” “What good is strong magic,” the chieftains scoffed, “if you must make friends with people you ought to be fighting?” Inganna said, “With a tribe, we can fight our common foes.” “Our foes are right here!” the chieftains cried. She offered to fight each and every one of them. They were quite ready to do this, and Inganna was preparing for the battle when Ernalda brought her implements of tribal regalia. She brought the Chest of Torcs, with which she could gift the clan leaders. She brought the Hall of Understanding, where people would settle their differences by talking them out. She brought the Crown of Authority, which made people respect her sacral powers and pledge allegiance to her. Most of the clans agreed to make the tribe, but there were still some who were stubborn. Then warriors of the Night Tribe came and attacked the quarrelling clans. Inganna led the fight against the Night People. Everyone banded together to fight these hungry enemies. After they defeated the night warriors, they acclaimed Inganna as their king. Inganna returned to the land of mortals, her quest successful. The god-talkers said that our next attempt to make a tribe would benefit from the favor of Orlanth. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jorator came to complain that his bride Eonislara had broken a promise to stay faithful to him before they were married. He wanted her bride price back. We told Eonislara that she should divorce him. Eonislara agreed that Jorator was being unreasonable. She came back to us. Jorator stalked off, threatening reprisals. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Leikan began the Storm Tribe heroquest. Leikan was unable to enter the realm of the gods. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Temertain, a thane of the Heran clan, complained that Bastakos insulted him, and said there would be a feud if we did not punish our trickster. We told Temertain he should not take Bastakos’s insults so seriously. After much discussion, he agreed that no one would think his honor besmirched by a mere trickster’s mockery, especially if he paid no mind to it himself. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kestald complained that his wife Arkilla dishonored him by interrupting a duel with Saronil of the Boskovi. He was told that this was not a matter for the clan ring. The people were happy that the ring was wise enough not to involve itself in a petty dispute. As for Kestald and Saronil, they met again, and took to sipping ale together, lamenting the meddling ways of wives. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1331&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The alynx spirits chased off the vermin spirits; there would be few rats this year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Our scouts found a strange clan of beast folk who were like ducks. With justice and mercy, we offered peace to the duck people, who henceforth gave our clan a place of honor in their songs. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We learned that the Herani had declared a feud against us. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Women from the Gorind clan came to urge us to help them prosecute a feud against the Boskovi. We offered to make peace between the feuding clans. The women seemed offended. “Make peace with those detestable rodents? Don’t suggest such a thing, even in jest!” We sent messengers to warn the Boskovi that the Gorinds meant them harm. The Boskovi thanked us for the warning; they said they would be our friends in the future. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A trickster came to laugh at us, and to offer us a blessing that would help us on our next heroquest. We demanded an apology. He apologized in such a way as to magnify the insult. We attacked him. We wounded the trickster and one of his guardians, and they ran off. Our honor was satisfied. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bastakos, the devotee of Eurmal on our clan ring, gave away a herd of our cows. We asked the Blue Spruces to give the cows back. They said that tricksters could never be trusted, and returned the cattle to us. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Intagarn spoke for the warriors when he said that they were stretched too thin, and that more fighters were needed. We sent Kulbrast on a mission to find the best warriors available. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yorsar approached us, seeking our support for his heroquest. We refused him, because our magic was weak. Yorsar flew into a rage, claiming we were liars. He picked up Vininna and threw her through the clan hall wall. Swearing gore-spattered vengeance on the cowards of Dragon Pass who did not understand the need for unity between Orlanthi, he departed. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A couple from another clan offered to sell us the Torc of Honor. We paid what they asked. We put the Torc of Honor in a safe place. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1332&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The god-talkers said we would be blessed with many children this year. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Enastakos of the Blackrock clan offered us gifts. We threw a feast for thanes of Enastakos’s clan. They toasted our generosity, and said they would speak of it to others. Our people made merry, and also toasted the clan ring. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Robasart of the Blue Jays wooed and married Eonislara. He proclaimed himself lucky to find such a beautiful and fertile wife. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;A bold young warrior named Gardrostan sought a duel with a champion of our clan. Orlaront accepted his challenge. The two fought a ferocious battle that seemed to go on for hours. Finally, our champion fell to his knees and spoke the traditional words of surrender. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Spirit-talkers showed up and asked if we needed anything from them. We did not want anything from them, but gave them hospitality. The old one told us we would be rewarded for our generosity. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As you can probably see, I'm not great at this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For Orlanth!,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/11/3-years-of-clan-history.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4907573821391154676'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4907573821391154676'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-3009819289444650534</id><published>2010-11-21T17:18:00.004Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.735+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='People I Shouldn&apos;t Fuck With'/><title type='text'>Can't sleep, Brutus will eat me.</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TOlUbP87--I/AAAAAAAAAEE/iToQQg2JU9A/s1600/BRUTUS%2BIS%2BCOMING%2BFOR%2BYOU.jpg"&gt;&lt;img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 239px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TOlUbP87--I/AAAAAAAAAEE/iToQQg2JU9A/s320/BRUTUS%2BIS%2BCOMING%2BFOR%2BYOU.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5542053643571428322" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;I saw this picture on Deadspin yesterday, and it makes me whimper in fear and laugh loudly at the same time, but safe to say just this is really unsettling, in ways I can't really articulate.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Yours with fear,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/11/cant-sleep-brutus-will-eat-me.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3009819289444650534'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3009819289444650534'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media='http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/' url='http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_u4eA1BIIafM/TOlUbP87--I/AAAAAAAAAEE/iToQQg2JU9A/s72-c/BRUTUS%2BIS%2BCOMING%2BFOR%2BYOU.jpg' height='72' width='72'/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-963597645877808209</id><published>2010-11-20T11:27:00.003Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.765+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Dreams'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sports'/><title type='text'>The Wrong Ball</title><content type='html'>Normally I wouldn't blog about a dream, I mean mostly I wouldn't remember them long enough to blog about them, but even ones I do aren't really blog-worthy, but this one definitely merits one, since it also leads to a longer thing about FIFA and corruption and all that in general. The dream actually started out as a different thing, where like half of my 13-strong primary school class were in Trinity, and me and this guy in the class above me who went off to play for Man. Utd. went off to play pool in the residence halls. But that was abandoned in favour of a weird thing where Gary Barlow was commissioned to write the World Cup 2010 song for the England team, only to have it banned because the video "disrespected the flag". The dream took the form of a guy who looked like Daniel Craig and who had a double-barrelled surname, interviewing Barlow about it. I saw bits of the video and then in the interview he said the real reason the song was banned is because the balls used in it weren't the official balls of the World Cup. This actually seemed plausible, but off the top of my head the only similar situation I can think of is when Marvin Harrison wouldn't sign a kid's trading card because it wasn't the brand that was endorsed by Marvin Harrison, which at first I thought was weird because he always seemed like a nice guy, but last week I found out he shot repeatedly at a couple of dudes for reasons unknown, and then did a revenge thing when word got out a few months later. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This was gonna be a longer thing about my beef with FIFA, and Sepp Blatter and Jack Warner and their rules about government interference and video refereeing and general corruption, favouritism, and all-around douchebaggery, but I guess you'll have to wait just a bit longer for that, partially because right now I need to brush up on my FIFA douchebaggery, but also right now I'm not pissed off enough to write about it. Maybe next time there's a game-changing decision video-refereeing would have reversed.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;[Football term],&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/11/wrong-ball.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/963597645877808209'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/963597645877808209'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-9047134052973416127</id><published>2010-11-17T22:43:00.004Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.764+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='nostalgia'/><title type='text'>On the changing nature of birthday celebrations</title><content type='html'>Last July I turned 19 (my birthday is in July so you should mark it on your calendar), and whereas in the past I would do something major for my birthday, this time I just went to see Inception and got a single drink in a pub. That's not to say Inception wasn't crazy awesome, I mean I just fucking love Nolan's movies, and this rivals Memento for, in my opinion, the greatest of them all. But yeah, compared to what I used to do, this was pretty minor, although Mully paying for a cinema ticket is certainly a turn up for the books. I also bought myself the Thief Gold collection, Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri, and Jade Empire, which were all quite a bit of fun, especially Jade Empire, which is a martial arts action-rpg by Bioware, and it's quite awesome. But I thought back to the birthdays I had when I was in primary school, and in fun and event quotient, there isn't really a comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So basically when I was in 10 or so, me and my brother were big into athletics, as were our friends. Generally, the upside of being in a rural primary school is a big fuck-off field for sports at break- and lunch-time, so basically our class and the class above us (with 3 dudes, one of whom went on to play for Manchester United and Triestina), and the class beneath us (several dudes, some of whom Frank knows), played football, and occasionally to shake things up, rugby or hurling of whatever was in at the time. Also, generally, there were several birthday parties a year up until 5th class or so where everyone got invited. You know the deal, birthday cake, coke, 3pm-6pm. One of these is where I played my first Sonic game, and it was good. Sonic had a reputation for that at the time. He doesn't anymore.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But yeah basically one year, my brother organised the most awesome birthday party ever. As I've mentioned before, we were big fans of athletics (I particularly liked Jonathan Edwards, Steve Backley, Javier Sotomayor, and Ato Bolden), and one summer, when the Olympics or World Championships or something were taking place, our friends and came over and we decided to have our own olympics. The good thing about our house and the surrounding area was everything was the perfect distance and layout for dudes our age. We generally just did the long jump, the sprint, a distance race (basically a lap around the house, or 3), a high jump, and something else, but I forget what it is. It was actually great craic, and out of the 5 who usually competed, it was usually a toss up for 3rd between me and Sean, with my brother and Robbie generally taking first and second. I came second once, cos I had insane short-distance speed, which I still kind of do, but not so much. But it was generally great, exhilirating craic, and when my birthday came around, word had gotten out that there would be an "olympics" as such, people were pretty excited. In the end we got like 15 people or so there, enough for heats anyway, and the whole thing was pretty fucking awesome. I think my bro still has the results away in the filing cabinet, so I might dig them out, but as far as I recall I got a top 5 finish.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Gradually, as time went on though, how I celebrated changed, until last year it wasn't even that big of a deal at all. I think for a while I'd go bowling or something, and when I turned 18 I went to Jackies, and then to Mully's house with Fitzy and Darver, where we partook of whiskey, pizza, expired bacon, and Wii Fit, a game that unintentionally calls everyone fat when they first play. But I mean this year it was just like "Inception? Sound". And generally everyone's is going in this direction, where it's just kind of an non-event piss up for the most part, unless there is a free house in which case it's either an awesome piss up, or a completely fucking terrible one (you know the type, generally some dramafriends are there, and shit is stirred). The completely awesome one, on the other hand, involves Liam Neeson kicking ass and dudes that piss you off getting rejected by chicks on the internet.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I guess the point is, that when I was younger, becoming a year older was an absolutely fucking huge deal, but now, it's like so what. &lt;a href="http://www.pbfcomics.com/?cid=PBF032-Todays_My_Birthday.gif"&gt;It's kind of like that PBF comic&lt;/a&gt;, but less morbid.&amp;nbsp;It's like, now a year older only represents an age increase of 5%, whereas back when I was 8 it was like 12.5%, which was fucking huge for a kid like me. I couldn't even count that high on both my fingers! I'm not sure if anyone else is like this, but I just noticed it and thought it might make an interesting post. Also when you were a kid, changing the words to Happy Birthday to "You look like a monkey, and you smell like one too" played like fucking gangbusters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm gonna sing a public domain song next time though, to honour Dan Rydell, who got a mad fine in &lt;i&gt;Sports Night &lt;/i&gt;when he sang Happy Birthday on air, and went around asking everyone what pubic domain song they'd like him to sing for their birthday. You should watch Sports Night, if you haven't already. It has the ultimate bromance, and is written by Aaron Sorkin. Plus it's got an awesome cast!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But I digress, this post is really what it says in the title, that aside about Sports Night notwithstanding. But that's about all there is to say on the topic, so yeah, I mean I just thought it was something I should share.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also got a bike that year, which was fucking awesome,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/11/on-changing-nature-of-birthday.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/9047134052973416127'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/9047134052973416127'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-1675395842741805407</id><published>2010-11-16T07:31:00.003Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.730+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Politics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Notions'/><title type='text'>McArdle for Councillor</title><content type='html'>Tonight I went to sleep at 11, and then woke up around 1. I talked to Andrew and Kevin for a bit, and looked at some pictures of that Wagner dude on X-factor that has everyone so mad, and then pretty much I talked to Darver for the better part of 6 hours. Or whatever time the last blogpost went up, cos although we'd been talking for a while before that, this was when the conversation went to McArdle for Councillor 2014.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Basically, we realised that although we liked this idea, we needed some solid numbers. Some research revealed a couple of things.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;We need 15 assenters (registered voters in the Ardee area) to sign for Darver's nomination for councillor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;That is, unless he runs for a party, which the Pirate Party would be the most obvious candidate, if they'll have us.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Darver realistically needs 900 votes to get a seat on the council.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;div&gt;We realised, after doing some maths, that this is really possible. A well-managed campaign and some targeted retail politics could get us that easily. Hopefully the Fine Gael government will be well on their way to getting Cowen-level poll numbers by that point, and Fianna Fail will still be hurting from the way they handle the crisis, which means we can hoover up a few swing voters, get people on the basis on both Darver's personality and policies. After a while, of course, we realised more could be done, and we started discussing what would need to be done if Darver were to run for TD. Later we discovered you need to be 21 to run, and with July 14, 2012 as the deadline for the next general election, Darver won't qualify. Balls to that, because we'd done some numbers and realised 1% of the first preference vote was very doable, especially if we could get votes from a) students b) the unemployed c) graduates under 30 and d) disillusioned Green voters and voters from the Father's Rights Party. Basically the whole thing was coming together pretty well, and even though it was unrealistic, it mostly served to increase the awareness of the name McArdle in local politics, which would have helped tremendously in 2014. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We also decided that we could use our friends to fill the key positions in our campaign staff. I'm probably gonna gauge people's interest over the next year or so, and start working on strategies, but ultimately I think we put together a really talented Dream staff, especially the guy we wanted to be in charge of fundraising, and the policy director. I don't wanna say who they are in case they say no, but they'd definitely do a good job. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also it was realised that Darver could sneak under the radar because he'd be the unknown candidate, and that the major parties probably wouldn't want the bad publicity that comes with smearing an everyman candidate. And even if one man in particular did (hint: he has a impostor twitter), the headline "TEACHER SMEARS FORMER PUPIL" would be a setback he couldn't afford as a rising member of his party. Ultimately, we've realised that with a small group of committed, able people, we can definitely get the 900 votes to put Darver on the council, we just have to execute the game plan. But hey, we have 4 years to prepare.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;UPDATES,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/11/mcardle-for-councillor.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1675395842741805407'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1675395842741805407'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7680448180232455128</id><published>2010-11-16T04:28:00.002Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.756+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Politics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Notions'/><title type='text'>Parish Pumps</title><content type='html'>An idea that's been floating around in my (admittedly small) circle of friends is the idea of running Darver for Liam Reilly's council seat come the next election. Admittedly it's a good idea, Darver's a pretty sharp guy, and can talk politics and deals with people pretty well. Plus it would be a fun thing to do, right, your friend running for elected office and participating in the process. But then, talking to Darver tonight, I realised how it would be an uphill battle to get him elected, even to a councillor seat. See the first problem Darver's style when talking about politics or the issues involved isn't to simplify it or to take whatever position is popular, but rather to go into some detail and bring a couple of other topics of discussion into it, which I mean first of all is kind of against the traditional Irish political style, and secondly, the reason someone from Fianna Fail, or Fine Gael, or Sinn Fein gets elected in Louth isn't policies or charisma for the most part, it's 90% a family's party loyalty. Basically getting Darver to beat Liam Reilly is an uphill battle. I mean it's not like a really steep gradient, but it'd still take some effort, but I think it would definitely be worth it. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Running on the Pirate Party ticket maybe might be a good idea and get some funding, like enough for some posters and proper local campaigning, but I'm not sure if they've actually registered as a party yet, even though they definitely have enough members. Their TCD branch is already much bigger than the respective Sinn Fein branch, and it's not because everyone there loves their rapidshare and their stealing from hard-working artists. I'm not sure what the point of this blog was, I just wanted to get this down (I'm actually blogging a lot lately, but is that a good thing?) because it's definitely something that should be given a crack, and many hands make light work, et cetera.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Signing off,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/11/parish-pumps.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7680448180232455128'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7680448180232455128'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-8145365516740369652</id><published>2010-11-16T01:35:00.003Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.759+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Politics'/><title type='text'>Carpetbagging</title><content type='html'>So basically during the last week, Arthur Morgan, a dude from Omeath who is a Louth TD, announced he wouldn't be running for re-election. Excellent, I thought, since I had a low opinion of this man. I mean they were probably gonna get Sharkey to replace him, but hey, at least he's gone, I said.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But then, suddenly Gerry Adams decides he wants to run for office in a country he doesn't live in, and, naturally, he's going to do it in the Louth constituency, where Sinn Fein could run the Gambler McCabe and he'd be elected easily. So the newspapers and media are covering it, but nobody's really come down on him for running in a constituency he's never lived in, and has only the most tenuous of connections to. There's an American term for that, carpetbagging, and sadly I haven't heard it, or the underlying concept, mentioned in today's media coverage, which is just saddening. But I think the worst thing is how everyone I ask is reacting. "LOL voting for Adams would be awesome lulz" being the basic gist, which I mean if you're gonna vote for someone cos it would be "awesome" then vote for the Monster Raving Loony Party or, y'know, a candidate and party that could legitimately use that term to describe themselves (Ralph Nader might qualify, but not by any conventional standard of awesome, but he's basically retired now. Bill Bradley would also count, Air Force reservist and basketball hall of famer, who went to Princeton and got a Rhodes scholarship. Doesn't get more awesome than that). &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mean Adams, since he's going to win pretty much by default, will now be the leader of a party in the Dáil. I mean apart from the obvious problems of having someone with such a poor grasp of the key issues and problems currently facing us as Adams with any kind of influence is just a frightening thought, but just as bad is the whole acceptance of this whole deal (which sets up Adams to run at the presidency before the Centenary, where he can lead the glorious parade celebrating some murderers and criminals), and the kind of perception I'm getting that voting for Adams is "awesome". I mean I understand that name recognition is a big deal is helping a carpetbagger get elected, but at least someone like, say, Hilary Clinton or John McCain, had shown intelligence and political acumen, rather than just criticizing the government when they do anything, and then offering policy suggestions that would actually be far worse. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is pretty much just a rant against Adams the Carpetbagger (that'd be a pretty nice nickname for him to be remembered by) but at the same time, I need to say it, since this whole deal grinds my gears, and knowing that both a) newspapers aren't really going to give much heft to the whole carpetbagger criticism, or even spend a majority of their Adams coverage time pointing out his deficiencies in key areas, and b) knowing that there's nothing I can really do to stop him getting elected, since he is running in Louth, where Sinn Fein is inexplicably popular. Shit sucks, dude.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I mean, really sucks,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/11/carpetbagging.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8145365516740369652'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8145365516740369652'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-1750971031859759108</id><published>2010-11-14T10:25:00.002Z</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.732+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Analogies'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Analogies</title><content type='html'>The Irish economic policy is a lot like the Oakland Raiders front office.

Instead of sitting on the tenner left over though, I decided to buy this HD remaster of GTI Club, which was one of my favourite coin-ops back in the day, but this new version was absolute bollocks, with about 3 tracks and no local multiplayer, it was just flat out not enjoyable, and I can't get a refund. But the local multiplayer, say for 4 or 7 players or even just 2, would have made it a great game, but without it, it's just flat out terrible.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hustle Kings on the other hand, is just an absolute joy to play. First off, the minor things: It's got a killer soundtrack, consisting of various generic jazz and lounge tracks (there are also rock and hip-hop and electronica tracks available, but I turned them off because they didn't resonate with my idea of What Pool Should Be) and damn good presentation. You also have to choose an avatar, and you choose from a bunch of "fashionable" dudes and dudettes in their mid-20s, but they all looked like tossers with the exception of one dude who looked just like Tom Hardy, so I went with him, then proceeded to lose my first 5 games or so to AI opponents, but then I figured it out and started owning Easy difficulty opponents. Nothing could stop my ascent, so I decided to play my brother in some local multiplayer (Hustle Kings bucks the prevaling trend by having some goddamned local multiplayer), and the experience playing with another person in the room is incredibly immersive, and feels a lot like actually playing snooker, except sometimes my breaks got into the double digits. So we played it once or so a weekend for a couple of weeks, and this week I decided to hustle online, where at first I got my ass handed to me badly, and then after a few more losses I finally won a game of 9-ball (my opponent then sent me a message saying GG, which takes me back to the days when I was racking up mad achievements and backstabs on TF2). But the main point I'm trying to make is even though on the surface they have the same amount of content, Hustle Kings has literally hundreds of hours more fun within it's archive than GTI Club+, which is the first game I've ever bought that I have regretted buying, and the one I've had the least enjoyment with (I'm someone who bought MTV Skateboarding back as a tot, to give you an idea of the fun abyss GTI Club+ represents).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;There are two different places that last paragraph is gonna take me off to, and the first is local multiplayer, and why it's awesome, and why games that don't have local multiplayer are the suxxors.  For example, the console version of Civilization (titled Civilization:Revolution), (a game I'm currently having crazy micromanaging fun with on my laptop) which I downloaded the demo for while this blog was on hiatus. I had fun with the demo, which lets you play as Egypt or Rome on a fixed, 5-nation map, and I thought I would maybe buy it at some point, since the games were fun and quick, and there was still a semblance of strategy. Gone, I thought, are the days of hotseat games with my bros that drag on for weeks at a time, now we can simply sit down, grab a controller, and play through the history of human civilization in a single night. But then while finding out more about this intriguing proposition, I found out it came with no hotseat, a game mode that formed the backbone of my early experiences with Civ (in the form of CivNet, don't judge, it came free with my dad's PC), but these days a forum post asking whether or not Civ:Rev had hotseat multiplayer got a response along the lines of "LoL hw wud that work o_O", which caused a great rage to form within me, and then I decided that unless it would going for a Steam Christmas Sale price, like a fiver or so (incidentally what the complete Civ III costs on Steam, go get it) , I would be giving it a large berth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I should probably at this point give some background, and talk about why local multiplayer is a huge deal for me, and here it goes: basically when I was young, there were 3 bros that were always hanging out with me and my brother. We were all big fans of games like FIFA, and Crash Team Racing (which is still the best racing game going, for my money, Mario Kart can suck it), but at first we only had 2 controllers, and it was still fun, but it meant imposing a winner stays on system with subtracted from the fun. But then, Sony Computer Entertainment, who at the time were infinitely wise, released the motherfucking multitap.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;img src="http://psxdata.snesorama.us/images/pads/multitap.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;Check out this beautiful motherfucking piece of machinery, Hot Damn!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;It was nothing short of a revelation, we rounded up the cash for 2 extra controllers (the DualShock was another awesome thing Sony came up with back then) and suddenly so much fun was being had. See the style of racing games back then was single player would have x opponents, and multiplayer would have x/2 opponents, so it meant the entire field was us, throwing skull bowls and bazookas at each other, and then raging at whoever was lucky enough to get that clock (you know the one I'm talking about). It also had the arena mode, which was even more fun, although some rounds devolved into making walls of potion beakers for shits and giggles. But it was four players so it became more complex and exciting, as rivalries emerged and someone got the 3 bazookas pickup. We could just play it for hours, playing through all the cups, picking on whoever decided to play as Tiny, it was just a flat out amazing game, and it was the multitap that raised from that level to God-like, a status it still holds today, at least with me, my brother, and the denizens of /v/. It was the main game to benefit from the multitap, but there were other games that just went perfectly with it; Nagano 98 for example, a 4-player winter olympics game that was also elevated to stratospheric regions of quality. My only real gripe with it was that it only recorded medals if you "qualified", which was a holdover from the arcade version, I'm assuming, but it meant that you'd go away from some events with nobody or only one person having a medal, and it could accumulate to become really annoying (Athens 2004 would later fix this, and it was also the game where my friend would discover a new technique of button-mashing that made everything that much more exciting). There were other games too, which if you had 5 controllers (which we eventually did), became perfect. NBA Live in particular (this was before the days of the 2k series, and I'm not sure if there were any competitors at the time), where with position lock it became an effort of teamwork and strategy rather than a game of Pass the Fucking Rock to Shaq He Can't Be Fucking Stopped. We created ourselves in game as well, (our heights and weights, understandably, were slightly exaggerated, and in the case of the tallest/largest of our group, extremely exaggerated) and put ourselves all on the same team, and proceeded to tear it up against whatever CPU team had the coolest logo (it wasn't the Cavs I can assure you);&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;&lt;img src="http://dimemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/90s-00s-cavs-logo-360x360.gif" /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;Just look at how ugly this logo is, I mean just look at it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;We won triumphantly every time, except for one occasion when I controlled an entire team, and the other four position locked as themselves, which led to Conspiracy Moment, something which I'll hopefully make a feature of every blog post from here on. Basically my avatar was controlled by the CPU, and he got the ball with the Broballers (they were actually called the jackrabbits or something, you only got a really small set of names to choose from) were 2 points down with 13 seconds to go. I was like "Fuck no" because the Broballers had been pretty good from the field all night, natch. But then my avatar, controlled by the AI, just ran out the clock, just stood there on the edge of the 3-point line, doing nothing, it was fucking weird, but I won, and I don't think anyone noticed my avatar had behaved in a way that had directly benefitted me. I mean had it been a horror game and not NBA Live (Hey, what's the difference between NBA Live and a corpse?) it'd make pretty good creepypasta, I reckon, but it was yet another Awesome Multitap Experience, or AME. I mean that's kind of it for multiplayer games we played, and it might seem like a lot just to play 2 or 3 games, but if you haven't had the brogaming experience that makes it worth it, then man, you missin' out; those multiplayer experiences defined 5th- and 6th-generation gaming for me, and they meant that everyone could be included, rather than having a rotating door system going on w/r/t who got to play. Even on the ps2, we got the new multitap for it, and although Crash Nitro Kart was an absolutely soul-crushing disappointment, and the first legitimately horrible Crash game (aside: When me and my bro were playing through CTR's story mode, our save got erased by a friend at 78%; after a brief moment of agony, we turned around and got full 120% or whatever it was completion lightning fast. In CNK our save was erased at about the same level of progress, and we just said fuck it, and never confronted whatever final boss that game had), we still had awesome games like Athens 2004 (4-player, 26 event olympics is an unbeatable marathon of fun, and when the shooting game comes up, waiting and frustration) and Nightfire: 007, which nerfed Oddjob so much, and had no Klobb. We also gave Madden a go with the multitap, and while it was interesting, the result wasn't really fun, so it didn't last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;But the point I'm slowly reaching is that, thus far, even with online play, I haven't really gotten that kind of thrill from a console game. There are some PC games that frequently reach those levels of fun, but so far on the PS3, Warhawk is the only game I've experienced that is such crazy fun, but it still comes with split-screen multiplayer, so 4 bros can connect to a single server on the same console, which is pretty sweet. MAG might be able to deliver, but I haven't heard enough good things to consider it, and at this point I have no idea how active the online community is. It was this sort of experience that made me love the vidya so much in the first place, and although the ps3 is slowly accumulating some awesome local 3-or-more multiplaya titles, like Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, Joe Danger, Hustle Kings, and Castle Crashers (and also NBA Jam which looks so damn awesome), but there are so many more games that I'd love to be able to play locally (GTI Club+ would benefit enormously from this basic feature) but instead they focus on the online component, which basically means it's impossible to find players 6 months after release in many cases, whereas if they had local MP you'd have some willing bros ready for one more turn, or whatever. I mean you can even have 7 controllers running at once on the ps3, and Civ:Rev would just be amazing with that, but no dice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" &gt;I think I promised another section to this post, again inspired by GoddamnTerribleInteractive Club+, which was going to be about games that are great in single-player, but are also fantastic in multiplayer, and it was mainly going to be about SSX, which I played the third instalment of today, but I've already passed 2,000 words in less than an hour (a new My Ace Hen record for longevity and pointlessness I'm sure) which is something I need to do more, since it basically means college will be a breeze in the wind from now on.

I could do it like Jay Electronica, and do a shitty liveblog, and then post excerpts of new posts and ask everyone to be extra nice because I'm sensitive about it, and then it's some cliché shit about chilling with Puffy in Miami and winning a Grammy for the family. That's catchy and all, but compared to what he was doing two years ago, it's pitiful. But he delayed Act II almost a year at this point, and I'm tempted to do the same but I made a forfeit with Frank that if I didn't post tonight, well I'd have to do something that almost certainly would end badly.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But today was pretty interesting, I got home early because my last 2 classes were cancelled due to the National March thing, so my only class today was the Sanders Lab, where he gave us Minstrels and Malteasers to explain the concept of an indicatrix, which is right now the most delicious geological thing going (Feldspar is a close second). But yeah I got home and at about 6 a Garda came around and I agreed to be part of an identification parade, which took about an hour, most of which was spent waiting around holding up a piece of paper with a number on it, and watching people play pool. I also got my mugshot taken, which hopefully will surface when I'm bald to show how badass my beard was. But anyway there were 9 of us in the lineup, 8 people the Gardai had wrangled up from NuBar and Shanowen, and the actual suspect, but they foolishly got a volunteer who looked just like the guy, so the witness ended up identifying one of the volunteers as the man who carried out the plan, and when she did the actual suspect's look of pure joy was a sight to behold. This is one of those Well You Had to Be There stories, but still it was entertaining as hell, and I got a mugshot out of it, and a story to tell whenever there's a lull in conversation. But hey I finished a post after so much dilly-dallying and now I don't have to carry out the forfeit.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Suck It Frank,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/11/assortment-of-dudes.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5524780171949473080'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5524780171949473080'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-8128693291060116492</id><published>2010-08-13T18:51:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.758+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Hiatus'/><title type='text'>Hiatus: The Return</title><content type='html'>Basically I'll be taking slightly less than a month off, to do some other things, but also work out what I actually want to do with this blog.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Out,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/08/hiatus-return.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8128693291060116492'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8128693291060116492'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-6678638286456794479</id><published>2010-08-11T18:55:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:01:56.750+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='College'/><title type='text'>Deadlines</title><content type='html'>This regular updating of my blog is probably a good idea, but at the same time this means its essentially become a non-paying, 3 hours a week job.

Studied, watched some How I Met Your Mother, searched the internet in vain for a download of El-P's new beat tape, but then at 9 my dad was all "you wanna go for a drive?" and I decided I'd try out Ger's (formerly known as Vinnie's (formerly known as Conor's)) to see what it was like, and also to test its viability as a late night post-entertainment meal option. It was actually pretty solid, the service was a bit slow and the chicken overcooked, but damn those were some good A- chips, just short of Macaris in terms of Irish chips I've had (nobody's gotten an F yet, Wales is another matter). Ger's will certainly have at least a tiny amount of my future "fast food" custom.&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tomorrow I'll stack it up against McDonalds, because August 10th is, in fact, Take Your Love Interest to McDonalds Day, the second actually. The first being when that guy took a girl to McDonalds after a movie, then she didn't answer his calls, and he wrote a long missive about Bitches and Whores Man because she expected somewhere not-McDonalds. It was also the real start of moot's long hate affair with /r9k/, which for a brief period was a good board, and after the Alpha as Fuck Transformice incident, might actually reach that peak again someday. But generally I've been avoiding 4chan since it's summer and unfunny summerfags are out in abundance.

They even had a "GUESS WHO WE HAVE 5 MICS TO" poll, to create some non-existent suspense. If they'd done it back in the era of The Chronic and Illmatic (there's like a year and half separating them, but that's the kind of contest that people would actually be interested in, mostly because of the East/West thing going on) maybe they could have had even bigger circulation numbers, but, I mean, it's 2010, if you asked Everyone Who Read the Source Between 1991-1994 if The Source still existed, most would be like "It exists, really?" when you told them. It was basically some NME-style posturing, except The Source is a rare music magazine that manages to be worse than NME (see also: Alternative Press, Rolling Stone, Hot Press), but I think I may already have touched that base back before I even had a beard. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The album also has Drake, which automatically disqualifies it from 5 mic status, but how was giving Bun B 5 mics supposed to resuscitate The Source anyway (I mean anyone could tell this was a poorly planned CPR attempt right)? It just makes it worse, now that rating is even more worthless, cos at least when Lil Kim got 5 mics for The Naked Truth everyone knew it was because her managed banged the Harvard guy who used to run it. Hopefully this hastens its downfall, fingers crossed it won't even exist in a few months, although even going the way of Blender would be acceptable.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting google result: "The Source wiki" doesn't even return a result for the magazine on the front page.

Also Ryan and Emma were there, those guys are pretty cool.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;So we just chilled out and ordered some pizza and shit was fun yo, a solid bro's night even though a chick was there (=[!), and I met Frank's cousin, and learned that Frank's broctitis is genetic, since his cousin was a similarly misogynistic but pretty sound dude, and he told me a pretty cool story about him and the Ass Tattoo Guy from my first grad night (The Toaster and the Cooker story of the title), who a year later shouted at Darver in the Williamson's Mall car park. I related the story of the Jug of Sick in return, since I realised it's a much better story than Psychobitch, which although it's enjoyable, doesn't really have a great structure and is thus low-tier anecdote. There are other good stories in my repertoire, but they're really more like minor distractions than the centerpieces that get people huddled around, but it's better that way. I'm glad I went out though, shitrox bro, the Store is a pretty chill place and I totally dug the vibe.

It's a fantastic show, and the cast is awesome, I mean it's got Neil Patrick Harris AND Jason Segel, it even had Nick Swisher for an episode, and that dude is a total bro. Season 5 was a huge letdown though, they totally wasted the awesome Barney-Robin shit and it just overall wasn't as funny, I mean there were periods where I wasn't laughing. Season 2 just wouldn't have let that happen. Season 5 did have that awesome musical number and The Playbook, but overall it still doesn't compensate, but whatever, it's an awesome show that you should watch. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Next up on my Shit to Put In My Shared Videos Folder is Treme whenever I download it, and the new episodes of Futurama, of which I've watched the first two.

But it was way out in this place called Reaghstown, and we used a really cheap Lidl/Aldi GPS to get us there, which, while it named every townland in Cooley, prompted my dad to espouse his theory that the GPS dudes know who everyone is.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But to the actual party, I'm actually writing this like 3 days later so I'm sketchy on the details, but I saw Eimear for the first time in ages so that was mad fun and I was like hells yeah, and I chilled with Charles and we discussed how Nas and Rivers Cuomo are really the same in terms of career arc and also music quality (more on this in a later post). Most of the night however was spent at a kitchen table with some Ardee dudes and Shane Byrne, while this dude named Gerry was being a hater and hating on the Beached Whales, and then I talked to this other guy about Queen and hitting on people. Also worth mentioning is some bros who acted in a very un-brolike fashion. I am disappoint, bro, you know who you are. It was actually an awesome party though, despite the gaggle of Drunk 16-Year Olds Coming to Realizations About Themselves, and a lot of good minor shit went down, and minor shit is the best.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Laid back,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/07/niamhs-gaff.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4365290921054071374'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4365290921054071374'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7096767830436695420</id><published>2010-07-20T21:58:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.329+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><title type='text'>Darv's Gaff</title><content type='html'>Last night was definitely the best time I've had so far this year, top 3 at least.

We also watched Taken which is fucking awesome, it's basically Liam Neeson bitch-slapping the world for a while. Darver also has minstrel figurines for some reason, but I can't even begin to guess.

The writing's pretty solid and the game's immersive, so I'll probably have one long session that gets me like 2/3 of the way through the game, I've also gained some Ice power, but I haven't really used it yet, since the basic Legendary Strike thing is working well so far, even against what are basically bosses. &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I've also seen Inception twice, and holy shit it's fucking good. When I first heard about it the news came around the same time the Jonah Nolan-Spielberg wormhole movie was announced, so far a while I kinda conflated them, but I still wanted to see it, because pretty much just Chris Nolan, who makes some fucking great films, Insomnia is probably my least favourite, and even that is fucking good. But eh yeah the film was actually really fucking fantastic, and I'll probably see it at least once more, since I have a pretty good idea of what's going on, but I just need to confirm it. The soundtrack's also pretty sweet, and Johnny Marr plays the guitar parts.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I didn't really do much else this weekend, I went to the Store briefly on Friday and Kevin and Lucy gave me a kick-ass homemade gift, and I wanna thank them again, then I talked to Kevin's friend Carl about shit for about an hour, and it was pretty entertaining, even if I was incapable of sticking to a single conversation thread. I don't have much lined up for this week though, Niamh's having a house party on the weekend, so I'll probably go to that, and also Toy Story 3.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bubi,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/07/money-in-bank.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8401143873764861352'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8401143873764861352'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7744081774378968271</id><published>2010-07-16T00:03:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.345+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Video games'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><title type='text'>A long-ass post to kick off a long-ass year</title><content type='html'>It's 0:04, and I'm celebrating my 2nd day of being 19 by helping Darver troll someone in Silence although it initially started out as Darver overthinking replies. I doubt the person he's texting reads this so I can say that Darver is not actually passed out on the benches below (no homo). &lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'm also reading Steve Albini's diary of the final Big Black tour (&lt;a href="http://petdance.com/actionpark/bigblack/tourdiary/"&gt;http://petdance.com/actionpark/bigblack/tourdiary/&lt;/a&gt;) which is really entertaining, and short so it's perfect for internet users everywhere! I'll side with that group, I just can't read things with page counts in the triple digits in .pdf format, I may have read chemistry notes like that but that's different, it's really like a series of 8 page historical short stories, except in 400 years cinema won't have made them seem hilariously inaccurate. I was legitimately bummed out when I found out vikings didn't have those horns. It's a good thing I don't have the Tyrant's Helm, I would've been tempted to craft it, like that Free Weekend Kid who was pissed he kept getting hats. I raged. TF2 IS ALL ABOUT THE HATS, THEY'RE THE ESSENCE OF TF2. Fitzy has not played TF2 that much since hats were introduced, and I'd join him if they weren't a complete cocktease that I just can't say no to. The camera beard did not sate me, and the mining light doesn't even do anything when you press the 'f' key.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I also read a very interesting piece about Antichrist Kotick, and it managed to lower my opinion of him somehow, even though he was already in the same circle as Martin Sludden, The Dude Who Cancelled Arrested Development, and Ubisoft's DRM. I was shocked at how he actually is completely comfortable with saying he wants to take the fun out of making video games, or he only wants Activision to publish games that can have Guitar Hero levels of over-exposure. The Starcraft II stuff was maybe the worst. Although previously I didn't really give a shit outside of bisu I am now rooting for Starcraft 1 to remain Korea's national sport. Activision make a thing out of charging people for what should be basic out-of-the-box services, but I guess when your company is run by dudes who hail from Nestle or Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, out-of-the-box means nesquik rather than, say, LAN Play, or a dev console, or dedicated servers.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And tomorrow I get to see Inception, a movie so intriguing Mully is actually going to pay money to see it, which enforces my argument that piracy results from apathy rather than whatever the RIAA blames it on, I can't even remember, I just remember the horrible maths they used. Gabe Newell said something, like piracy is only a concern if you're putting out shit. I completely agree. I've bought pretty much every Valve game except L4D1 that they've put out in the last 5 years. By comparison, I've bought one UbiSoft game, and it was used, and it was Michel Ancel and he's an exception to their Rule of Crap. I'll be going to the Store too, and there should be a few people there, and hopefully Eimear if I don't make it to town at 1, it's been way too long.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I got Jade Empire anyway, and also the Thief Collection and Alpha Centauri (which runs on Linux, the RMS trolling begins), which was a pretty good deal for 30 quid, compared to Steam prices (the barometer of value), and I picked up The Force Unleashed for my bro used, 12 quid, which raises my PS3 games count to 7, which is 7 more games than the PS3 actually has. I was intending to watch Jackie Brown today too, but between the haircut and the Magee's Bistro (steak was completely underdone, but still good, although first time it's been less than perfect), and the losing 4-1 as Spain to New Zealand in a FIFA match against my bro, it got lost in the shuffle. I'll put it on tomorrow probably, after I cram some Soils up in. Read the Democrat too, in the barber's today, but the observations I mined are going to saved and stewed for another post, when more perspective is available. I'm not sure what my parents have against the Democrat, maybe because they put the Lordship news in with Cooley? That's really all I could think of, the journalism itself was pretty solid, which is the first time I've been able to say that about a publication in a while, I mean Uncut is good, but mostly it's pretty unremarkable C+ standard stuff, although they had a really good article about Bitches Brew period Miles this month, which somehow made Miles Davis even more badass, a shame he had to be a prick about getting $50,000 upfront for a Miles-Hendrix session, I mean how fucking great would that have been?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Guided by Voices Classic Lineup have also announced a tour, but there's no chance I'll be able to make it. I'd punch a bear and shit to go, but it's not gonna happen, but it's ok because I have the Bala's Birthday bootleg, although I still haven't heard The One Where Bob Offers the Soundman a Blowjob, or even Relaxation of the Asshole, which makes me a pretty shitty fanboy, I don't even have his Soderbergh soundtrack.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;!Checo Esos Doubles,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/07/long-ass-post-to-kick-off-long-ass-year.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7744081774378968271'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7744081774378968271'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-5829233465276774902</id><published>2010-07-14T20:14:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.305+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Catching up'/><title type='text'>Free as in freedom</title><content type='html'>Today is my last day of being 18 I think, and it's like 11:33 so it's less than half an hour. I'd do a long-ass sentimental as fuck recap but nah plus I'm not sure what I'd include or exclude I mean I could be here quite a while, but eh basically today was actually pretty good. Yesterday I was in town too and I ended up talking to Shane Byrne and Jack mostly, but also Ri and Niamh and Sarah.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But today I came in primarily to look at phones, but I don't really see much of a point in upgrading, the HTC Desire looked good but the price was prohibitive, so I'm gonna stick with the reliable, servicable 3410. Then I met Frank and watched him gay it out with yet another dude, and then pretty much just bummed around as always, little was done. I was going to get my hair cut but there was an insane queue, so I just got the bus and read Uncut, which is pretty much the only music-related thing I really read nowadays, except for Bol's Saturday Night Workout, which is fantastic. I've also installed an Ubuntu partition on my laptop, so I might do some blogs where I troll RMS by loading my laptop with propietary software and talking about how great open-source is.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tomorrow is dinner with my fam anyway, good times, and then Friday I'll see Inception with my bros, and go to the Store, looking forward to it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I'd like to interject for a moment,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/07/free-as-in-freedom.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5829233465276774902'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5829233465276774902'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-247542978722225186</id><published>2010-07-12T16:32:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.229+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sports'/><title type='text'>Cathal's Gaff</title><content type='html'>Eh I stayed at home and watched the Louth/Meath match, and saw some absolutely horrible refereeing, then afterwards, some spineless behaviour. First off Joe Sheridan talking about how it was such a great goal, then RTE News not even mentioning the nature of the goal, and presenting the story as essentially Butthurt Louth Fans Can't Handle Their Defeat By a More Commercially Attractive Team, although the Sunday Game was spot on, and props to Eamonn McGee in the Irish Independent, for pointing out true justice would be giving the title to Louth, since this was unambiguously Louth being robbed of the title with a bullshit 'goal' that was also the last touch of the game. The behaviour of a few Louth fans afterwards ain't the issue, and you all fucking know it. Also Meath fans need to stop whining about the ref being totally Louth-biased throughout the match, they got the exact same number of calls as Meath. But yeah I just really mad. Mad at Sludden, mad at Sheridan, mad at the umpires, mad at the Meath manager and the Meath county board, and mad at Christy Cooney.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If it goes down how I expect it to and Meath chicken out and hand the matter over to the GAA (who they know won't give a replay of their own accord) then there needs to an absolutely fucking huge asterisk beside the 2010 Leinster title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I REALLY MAD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Stop Whinin', Stop Lyin',&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/07/cathals-gaff.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/247542978722225186'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/247542978722225186'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-2535343675051825457</id><published>2010-07-10T19:36:00.005+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.235+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><title type='text'>Christine's Gaff</title><content type='html'>So yesterday was meant to be Day Two of Broxegen but I was mad sick so I had to skip it, apparently I missed some unusually homoerotic Ro-Frank shit but I would just have spent most of the night doubled over so y'know it was everybody's gain. But today I wasn't sure if anything was happening, so I was preparing for a night of Dinosaur Comics and brochat when Christine called me and was like "Do you wanna come down dude?" and then 10 minutes later Larney rang asking me if I had anything that would let them play films off a hard drive on a tv, so I got my HDMI cable and packed it along with my small external, which had Sims 3 which I was going to give to Christine.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I got there though, they weren't even watching films, they were having a states-naming contest, and then me and Christine had a conversation about Achewood, which she's finally up to date on (if you're reading this, you should read Achewood, but not the most recent one, just click random comic as soon as possible), and we tried to work out who was like who, but didn't get much further than Darver = Ray, although I see myself as kind of a Teodor or Chuckle Bot, although secretly I want to be Cornelius, like probably Teodor does.  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;But eh we ended up deciding after much deliberation and the arrival of Frank to watch The Dark Knight, which is some compelling shit, props to Nolan, I am sure Inception will be great, that dude knows how to make films.  But after we paused it to go into the kitchen to get drinks we ended up talking for a while and just not resuming it, it was actually seriously good to get together with my bros and talk in a dark room for a couple of hours, it brings me back to that night in the Dutch House when that car pulled up outside, and we rushed to turn off all the lights. We ended up just talking about all kinds of things, and I also outlined my Prequel Trilogy to Kevin, and even he agreed that it was phat, so I might actually y'know write it down at some point.  Eventually they went home so I was like giving the Sims 3 ISO to Christine, and then we had a Tetris contest that I lost horribly, I am just not good at that game. Apparently me and this other person also have similar fringes, although maybe that's a Christine Metaphor I don't get. But tl;dr, Christine is seriously awesome, a true bro.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also I found out the Trinity Library was the inspiration for the Jedi Archives in Star Wars, much of yes, and also I have the Star Wars font on my PC. Shit is good.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Tomorrow I have a free house since my parents and bro are at the match, so I'll have Cathal's Gaff up Monday, although it'll probably just be 500 accounts of me getting high on brick cleaner and cussing the couch.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Oh, also Brofist to Charles and Niamh.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I only sniff double brick cleaner,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/07/christines-gaff.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2535343675051825457'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/2535343675051825457'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-9139104450550858664</id><published>2010-07-08T23:14:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.379+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Broxegen'/><title type='text'>Ri's Gaff</title><content type='html'>Eh today was pretty solid, I'm completely crippled with these horrible abdominal pains, but I went into town anyway cos it was Broxegen, and I met Ri and Feargal and we hung out for a while and then Frank showed up, and we got some food, and walked to Ri's, which is where I found out about a true bro called Sean.

Then I got home and slept for hours, also my camera was out of battery so I don't have any photos. The aquarium was pretty awesome and I saw pretty much all the sights, while listening to this catchy muzak-funk riff which was total easy-listening avenue. I'd do a longer post about it but I'm way too exhausted.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Today I went to this burger bar as such, called le 86, and I had the best burger ever. Then I went to school and got an A. Born in the U.S.A. I've also been listening to El-P's Bieber remix for the last half an hour, holy shit this is banging. El-P should remix all those popular artists I can't stand, he has a pretty good track record with it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also my favourite band ever, Guided by Voices, are doing a reunion show for the Matador Records anniversary party, and it's the lineup with Tobin Sprout and Greg Demos, and also Kevin Fennell and Mitch Mitchell, who I thought was missing? I guess money brought him out of hiding from his job as a fry cook in Oregon. It should be pretty good, although if it's not a one-off thing then I MAD, cos Bob was all Nah I won't reform GBV now, that cheats the fans, that's something The Who would do!

Twice! I went to The Store on Friday, the Thieves were launching their EP, they're alright, better people than musicians, y'know? I talked to a few people, but none really at length, and I'm pretty sure I pissed Sarah off in a huge way, but I can't really ask her Y U MAD THO? without making it worse. I went to Macs the next night, and there was nobody there at first, so I talked to Starkie (one of the Original Leads) and then 2 members of my Wolfpack and Emma showed up, and we got some delicious discounted Domino's Pizza, although I didn't have a huge appetite, I was just needed somewhere to go, The Reformed Trends/Hot Stuff played, and they were pretty tight, although Macs isn't a great setting when there's only 7 people watching the band. It's still about 7 times more than I expect for the first gig Me, Frank, and Eleanore put on (I'm split between whether Ri or Christine would be the only attendee, shit, maybe we'd get a massive crowd of 2), but I went to the smoking area and chilled out. Not much really happened anyway, I dunno, Ri was also there, but mostly I chilled with Neil and Emma, and, later on, Shane Byrne! I see those guys a lot, but it's not a problem cos they're pretty cool and don't afraid of anything, also Shane Byrne is in my Wolfpack.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I had more written about a concern I had, but it was a) trite as fuck and b) way too baring of the emotions. I'll get someone's counsel on it later, and see how I should approach shit, although I should probably just let it go, I dunno.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Also, I'm doing the Yes Man thing for the month of July, feel free to hit me up for degrading favours.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;RAIN ON YOUR DREAM FIELD,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Cathal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/toning-down-esoteric-rap-talk.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/994240088299114551'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/994240088299114551'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-4014880900274427249</id><published>2010-06-24T22:56:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.247+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Catching up'/><title type='text'>Texas</title><content type='html'>Eh the big thing I discovered since the last post was the Texas branch of the Republican Party put out their new platform, which sounds pretty old school.

I've played the first 3 recently (I might do a Let's Play of Enter the Dragonfly at some point, but I'm not sure I could handle the terrible frame rates and the sub-RTE 3d graphix. 2 is definitely my favourite, it has hella solid characters, and although the writing doesn't touch Ratchet and Clank, it's still pretty enjoyable. The music for 2 is also beyond God tier, the homeworld themes are these incredibly chill ambient pieces, which sadly weren't imitated for YOTD, which instead has pretty fast paced pieces which don't suit my cycles. Hurricos is also brilliant, on some Warp Records shit, the rest is solid too, but those 3 pieces are in my rotation something serious, along with MURS, who I've listened to a bit in the past, but I put on The End of the Beginning a couple days ago, and holy shit, it's good. My summer soundtrack has become Jay Elec, Ghostface, and MURS, some solid chill rap music. Times is good.

To the Store. Twice. Although I didn't pay in either night, I mostly chilled outside and went to the Spot. Thursday was an End of Leaving! thing, although I ended up hanging with Ryan, Niamh, and Orla for most of the night. I love those guys, and Ri was there too, who's getting a shout out for making me look I under-think things. She knows what I'm talking about. Nothing much happened, it was just a good buzz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday was pretty much the same, I got free Mullens thanks to the awesome people at www.just-eat.ie, who were giving a tenner off all orders in celebration of the France-Mexico result. It was great, I picked it up with Neil and Sinead O' Connor. Both true bros to the bone marrow. Frank was there too, making me look heterosexual by comparison. I mostly chilled with Sarah, who I hadn't seen since she left for Scotland. I also talked for about half an hour to someone who I have no idea who they were, but we saw eye-to-eye on issues. I only finished the last post today, so this one is pretty short. I don't have much going on next week. I'm going to DKIT on Tuesday with Mully and Darver, and Ardee at some point with Niamh to see the Blind Pilots.

After the group broke up, Ice Cube briefly became a provocative rapper making great albums like AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted, and Death Certificate, but after the L.A. Riots, he slowly started becoming the new Bill Cosby. You can catch him in a family movie in a cinema near you every few months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other guy, Dr. Dre, was a producer mainly, but he was also a pretty bad rapper who sounded like Slick Rick (the British guy with the eye patch). He produced The D.O.C.'s album while he was with N.W.A, it was awesome. Then that same guy told Dr. Dre he should make a solo album, so he strongarmed people into writing him lyrics with hilarious insults (Gap in your tooth, so my dick's got to fit, etc., etc.) and although the production was up to the usual awesome standard, a new protege called Snoop Doggy Dogg was really the only reason to listen, then he produced Snoop Dogg's debut album, which was awesome. 6 years later, he signed Eminem, and put out a slightly better album, 2001, where his rapping was actually listenable. Eminem put out 3 fantastic albums with him aswell, and then they both seemingly lost their touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though I had no real reason to be hopeful, I still had pretty high expectations for Dr. Dre's 3rd solo album, Detox, which he's been working on for about 10 years now, but then yesterday the first single leaked, featuring Jay-Z, which was just awful. He'd played a segment of a Detox track on a Dr. Pepper ad (?) and it sounded alright, but this was awful, the rhymes were sub-Blueprint 3 (bad jokes and punchlines and references) and the music was Fruity Loops style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Dre, I am disappoint,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/detox.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6776391496928840994'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6776391496928840994'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-9169186160553545037</id><published>2010-06-14T23:10:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.386+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Comics'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sports'/><title type='text'>Duck Tales!

They alerted me to the current state of the Lantern corps (The Green Lantern was never a character/concept I was huge on, it seemed more unbalanced than Superman, and his weakness was even more ridiculous, I mean the colour yellow, word?), and also my favourite superhero ever, The Sentient Maths Equation! Also included is a sentient box, those comics are seriously fucked, although the box is still better than Larfleeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also had to replace my awesome Sennheiser headphones, but I ended up getting the same pair again, except I chose to buy the same pair, unlike TF2 where I get the same weapon over and over and over even though a hat would be cool not that it's a big deal but I'd dig a hat. Not much else is going on though, since most of the people I hang out with are doing the leaving, I need to set up a homegroup, but I still need to backup everything I want to keep. So mostly I've been chilling, and reading geography textbooks. I had this absolutely horrible dream, but I can't really blog about it.

It was just cream! I mean it was still good, I finished it and everything, but it was disappointing, it was like when Weezer reformed without Matt Sharp, except the bun was still palatable! I dunno what the deal is especially since fresh strawberries and raspberries are in abundance I must express my disapproval of this development, the powerful cream lobby must have gotten hold of them. The press should do something about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should also do something about John Boehner being all supportive of the idea that the Federal Government should pay for the BP cleanup, and also of the idea that making BP pay is somehow harmful to capitalism. Fuck them. The Irish Independent could benefit from good journalists from example, and less advertorials, although I appreciate that a paper needs to pay the bills, charging 600 for a job advert should do that, right? It's a changing environment and all, but why papers aren't taking pointers from the San Francisco Panorama, which is pretty much like Pele and Michael Jordan crossbred and put into newspaper form, oh God, I wouldn't know where to start. Basically it has long form journalism and great comics and photography and all these things that would make me buy a paper, I used to read the Independent for Dilbert, but now "Newspaper Comics" is absolute shit like Girls &amp; Sports, or Nemi, with some occasional greatness from Cul de Sac, which doesn't get enough exposure considering how fantastic it is. National newspapers are pretty much fucked though, but there's still going to be a market for local papers, I mean Dundalk manages to support 2 (technically 3), but in the U.S. there are cities with huge populations that can't support more than one. A paper is still preferable to having to rely on exclusively online news sources, most of them are atrocious, like WorldNetDaily, or hilariously naive and irritating, like the Huffington Post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YEAH BOI,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/jar-of-jam-ton-of-bricks.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8485066504569250939'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8485066504569250939'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-6007829502459869874</id><published>2010-06-10T21:17:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.312+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><title type='text'>Print</title><content type='html'>I'm just back from the Blessing of the Graves which was alright, the weather was perfect we didn't have to do it in an undersized church or have it rain down halfway through, although there was more of the weird skirting around the scandal, but referencing it at the same time, which is just awkward for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mad new music up in too, I got the discographies of Living Legends, the Residents, Sam Cooke, and the Streetlight Manifesto, although I haven't heard the last band and I'm just going on /mu/'s recommendation, and although that may seem foolish, introducing me to Emancipator buys you a lot of leeway. I don't really read that many music magazines anymore though, online or print, sometimes I'll buy Uncut, but even that's just 4 times a year, and maybe XXL twice. The difference is Uncut is genuinely enjoyable though, XXL is more like hanging out with your old friend who is now pretending to like a lot of annoying pricks because they give him money, although he still has more dignity than the Source, which is the lowest a magazine can get. XXL just really doesn't give a fuck anymore though, like in 97 Funcrusher Plus could get press from magazines (Look, I know they were funded by James Murdock and Rawkus at the time, but they'd been generating heat before they had that) but now even Madvillain's new album or a Can Ox return would get maybe a paragraph beside the adverts for "liquid trust", because, at heart, all heads are insecure about their girls. I'll pick it up the week the Camu Tao album finally drops, just to see if they mention it at all. They probably won't. But they have plenty of room for trying to make us think Soulja Boy is a serious artist, or that Asher Roth isn't complete dirty bongwater. Or when I picked it up one time and they talked about how Charles Hamilton was so emotional and complicated, when it was completely obvious he was low as a snake and couldn't rap. You can also see every edition of the Freshmen 10 for this, although this year's wasn't too bad by comparison, J. Cole, Freddie Gibbs, and Wiz Khalifa are all people whose debut albums I'll be downloading, but then there's B.o.B. and Ace Hood and Asher Roth, who are only on those lists because their labels paid for it. But yeah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have the Dark Cloud ISO on my drive, and I'm really hyped about playing that, I had the demo disc back when I got a ps2, and we used to have races to see how far down the dungeon you could get in the time the demo allotted before it went back to the demo selection screen. I'll probably play Shenmue too, cos driving a forklift is like a life-long dream for me, and I can't wait to play a simulation of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how we do it in the 10s,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/print.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6007829502459869874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/6007829502459869874'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-5192494347140904740</id><published>2010-06-08T23:32:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.296+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Video games'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><title type='text'>Basement Panther: The Quickening</title><content type='html'>Today so far was pretty good. I actually got up early for the first time this summer, since it's a lot easier now that my bro's home and we can chill in the early morning. He wanted to get a Spain jersey printed so we went into town, I ended up chilling with Darver and Noonan before they waffled their way through English Paper 2, and got a tasty burger, although the quality of Burger King fries has been on the decline this past year, all I'm saying. I split Red Dead Redemption with him too, so far it's pretty good, Ridan and Shootan Coyotes and Cowboyan, apparently it's a long ass game, so I'm looking forward to it, hopefully I won't rack up 150 hours like I did with Final Fantasy X, which was odd cos it isn't like the characters were the most compelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's a Blessing of the Graves I'm going to tonight, and if the weather holds up I might go to Ravensdale for a spot of camping, which for me means walking up and down a mountain listening to Blood on the Tapes all night. I just prefer the acoustic version of Idiot Wind over the one on the final album, although it might be a bit too vicious, but it's probably my favourite Dylan bootleg overall, although Thin Wild Mercury and Supper Club Soundboards are also excellent, the version of Ring Them Bells at the Supper Club is just mind-blowing, a lot of the Oh Mercy songs sound great live actually, much better than the album, which is dragged down by the production, all mysterious bayou ambience, only really suits Man in the Long Black Coat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the new Eminem album too, it's solid, although the first 4 tracks belong on the cutting room floor, you could make a fantastic album to rival Marshall Mathers by combining the best tracks from Recovery and Relapse and Refill, similar to how you could make the mythical Good Post-Illmatic Nas Album by taking 5 tracks from Stillmatic, 7 from God's Son and 2 from Street's Disciple. I'll do that someday, I'll post the tracklistings on here too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I've been cycling at least 10 miles a day, which feels great, and I've been macking heavily on wholegrain bread, beyond delicious, especially the Subway wheat bread, which is incredible. I need to start doing some weights too, to keep it varied, and I'm gonna climb Sliabh Fiadh with Eoghan maybe tomorrow before the World Cup starts, although neither of the Friday matches inspire much interest, I'm far more enthusiastic about USA/England, mainly for Will England Finally Actually Play Well in a World Cup?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I've started reading the paper again too; Kevin Myers has gotten a lot better in the 3 months I was away, not that I regret that I stopped reading it, I'll probably read the local papers too now, with the exception of the Dundalk Leader and the online Examiner, which is a joke, although the writing is of a better standard than the Leader, which I haven't picked up since my uncle was on the cover with his new lambs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/basement-panther-quickening.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5192494347140904740'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/5192494347140904740'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-4573571209643780565</id><published>2010-06-06T16:02:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:04.273+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Crazy pills</title><content type='html'>Back in the day, when everything was all smooth, making fun of embarrassing musicians and movies was completely non-taboo, it was like Dido is HILARIOUS, Sly Stallone's movies are enjoyably bad, and so on and so forth. But now it's 2010, and  when these kind of things come along, nobody makes fun of them or even calls them out on being shit, all you find is apologists talking about how Jedward are just as valid as Arcade Fire, or Robert Christgau giving Soulja Boy's album an A-.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only noticed this recently though, after a couple of things started happening:&lt;br /&gt;A) Every rock magazine put Hole on the cover, and acted like Courtney Love had talent.&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;B) Almost everyone I know started talking about Blink-182 as some kind of brilliant band on the level of Pink Floyd or Can, artistically unassailable, to the point where Jedward covering that terrible song All the Small Things was some kind of public indecency committed against music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was pretty weird, especially since Hole and Blink-182 are basically the rock equivalents of Jim Jones and Drake. Of course you won't find anyone admitting this, which makes point C)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;C) People will often place shitty rock music ahead of shitty music of any other genre, or even good music of any other genre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You've probably heard this. Electronica isn't music because "they don't even play instruments" and hip-hop isn't music because it's "just bitches and hoes" (Squarepusher? Hrvatski? The Roots? Public Enemy?), and any example that disproves their dumb-ass generalization is either not a real example of that type of music, or just further proves how right they are.  There aren't really that many people who fall under this anymore, mostly they're either above 20 and failing/dropping out of college, or under 15 and they've just heard Nevermind for the first time. Y'know the type, they compare new albums to Sgt. Peppers a lot, and they probably got really upset when the dude from Slipknot kicked the bucket. They usually have one exception to their genrelizations too, usually Eminem and Daft Punk (although lately, it's becoming the Steve Aoki crew, y'know, the asian dude who does the incredibly lazy remixes) and they talked about how Oxegen this year would be flooded with knackers because they had the gall to book rappers rather than more overrated bands who have nothing to recommend them but their guitarist (Protip: Oxegen's lineups have never actually been that good). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I'm probably just ranting like this because I think The Cold Vein was the best album of the decade, but what's with this pretending Sid Vicious is better than Soulja Boy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/crazy-pills.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4573571209643780565'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4573571209643780565'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-8921371346397709492</id><published>2010-06-04T23:45:00.003+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.313+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Music'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Radio</title><content type='html'>In 1985, this 17-year old kid from Queens put out a rap album called Radio, on Def Jam. That album was fucking hardcore, it was just absolutely incredible. It had songs like I Can't Live Without My Radio and Rock the Bells, which was so awesome that almost 20 years later they named America's biggest hip-hop festival after it. It's flat out great, but like in 2010, everyone thinks of LL Cool J as the dude from Any Given Sunday or something, do people even know he had a musical career? It's depressing, like he started writing ballads and it was all downhill, which sucks, cos he was one of the best rappers. The same thing would have happened to Buddy Holly if he didn't die though, slowly becoming a 2nd-rate romantic lead and taking emphasis off the music, or more likely he would have been just like Pat Boone, and Weezer would make it big with Harmonica Frank. Of the rappers going right now, Kid Cudi's the most likely to go like LL Cool J, except his debut album wasn't really that good, although Make Her Say is awesome (It was part of that 6 months where it looked like Kanye West had learned how to rap, then he vanished and came back and suddenly he was an awful MC again).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eminem's on the Jonathan Ross show now too, he has that new album with the great sleeve, and he put out that amazing freestyle which was just like Holy shit. I'll still get the album, but I'm not hugely excited, Kobe? Travis Barker?? Rihanna??? Pink???? It'll probably leak over the next couple of days so I'll put up my thoughts when I hear it. Hopefully it won't be like Encore, great flows but terrible beats. But Encore had Puke, so it can't be worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tremolo,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/radio.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8921371346397709492'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/8921371346397709492'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-9221072366172473248</id><published>2010-06-02T23:11:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.316+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Poorly conceived'/><title type='text'>No hooks, no drums, just new shit.</title><content type='html'>So this is basically the long post which I've been promising for about a fortnight like I was Darver and the long blog post was studying, but yeah this is gonna be William Gaddis long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uhh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fuck that shit.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/06/no-hooks-no-drums-just-new-shit.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/9221072366172473248'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/9221072366172473248'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-5936891849286737957</id><published>2010-06-01T00:39:00.000+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.297+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Placeholder'/><title type='text'>June Swoon</title><content type='html'>New month.

The new Kanye West song came out, and it was built around a 21st Century Schizoid Man sample, and I'd be saying that's pretty cool if kids still listened to rap music, which they don't, Fruity Loops and Autotune is what's popular now, but the song itself is alright, but I don't really see it being a bit hit, which is kind of expected from a Kanye album in general, but I'm still excited about it, it was a less cringeworthy leadoff than Not Afraid. Man that song was terrible, what's Eminem doing working with Jim Jonsin and Boi-1da, but not fucking Alchemist? Also when is William Regal going to drop a mixtape, DJ Skee should definitely get on that, it'd be way better than Charles Hamilton.

Someone sued over a lack of action after using Lynx recently, but whether he actually felt aggrieved or was just another project of lawsuitmania, well it's not a mystery. Maybe if you joined a cult to get fresh with the fine women then it would be less mercenary to sue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doug E. Fresh needs to make a comeback by the way, hopefully he'll make an appearance with Slick Rick on Rock the Bells. Rock the Bells has an excellent line-up this year, Wu-Tang, Rakim, and KRS One are all playing some of their best albums in full, although I would have rathered Rakim to do Follow the Leader than Paid in Full. I Know You Got Soul and My Melody and I Ain't No Joke are good and all, but Microphone Fiend is untouchable, listening to the RATM cover is very painful, Zach de la Rocha just cannot rap, it needs to be said over and over, he's definitely on my list of Terrible Rappers Who Need to Stop Already, along with Flavor Flav (who ideally would be replaced by a younger, less annoying equivalent; Public Enemy live would get so much better, I mean they toured with the Roots, but Flavor Flav was there bringing it down by existing in the vicinity of Chuck D and also the Roots), along with Insane Clown Posse, and Drake (my god I do not get Drake's popularity, he can't sing or rap well), and most of G-Unit, and there's probably a few others, but the ones I can think of have either basically retired from it (Master P) or don't really appear on my radar at all and thus don't get a spot (Lil' Boosie). But basically there are a shit load of awesome acts at Rock the Bells, Clipse, MURS &amp; 9th Wonder, Ill Bill, and Brother Ali. There are a couple I never really got into (Immortal Technique) and then there's the Make Boots Riley Look Bad Band (Street Sweeper Social Club). Lauryn Hill's on the bill too, which is going to be awesome for all the wrong reasons. I'd love to hear Miseducation re-done as a polka album, that seems like something she might do. Lauryn Hill is crazy, seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the Lost finale is a post in itself, but basically how did they manage to not answer ANYTHING in a 100-minute episode?

I really should have made more of it. Woke up at like 11, went for a walk along the beach, and then had some delicious tortillas, played some Ratchet and Clank, and read Brief Interviews for Hideous Men. I've actually played all the games Frank gave me last week now, so I can give some Prindle-style run-downs of 'em.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brutal Legend: The idea was a lot better than the actual execution, combat is clumsy and annoying and Jack Black interjects during gameplay in a way that grates after the 3rd repeat of an unfunny quip. But it's Tim Schafer, it's still funny and well presented, but I'd much rather watch someone else play it for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratchet and Clank Future: Fuck Yeah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LittleBigPlanet: Actually got round to playing it online, the user-created levels had neat ideas, especially the survival ones; The Shark one was fun as hell. But the gameplay is still uninspiring. But Stephen Fry and fantastic music compensate. Still not sure why Edge gave it a 10/10, speaking of which I need to pick that up tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow is also a couple of other things. I'm hanging out with my bro Frank for the last time before his leaving, and then I'm heading out to Tallanstown, for the Carpo/Sas farewell party. Saturday I'll probably go into Dundalk and get my haircut, although I Wrestled a Bear Once are playing in Eden Quay, I'm not sure I'll be able to make it, which sucks, cos it's gonna be the last awesome gig before the Leaving's over, at which point Hot-Stuff play Macs and the Whales are re-united. Elsewhere in music I've been listening to Deftones and some early Def Jam records. I can't believe it's taken me this long to get LL Cool J's first album! My library passed 27000 songs a couple of days ago too, and if I get round to labelling my marching band mp3s, it'll be at 28000, which right now is maybe half of Mully's.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jar of Jam,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal Murphy</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/05/strictly-business.html#comment-form' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3402873972855181439'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/3402873972855181439'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-1287991994029820400</id><published>2010-05-19T21:27:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.283+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Laziness'/><title type='text'>Large and in charge</title><content type='html'>Home again for the summer pretty much.

The first bum note of the summer yeah I see the pun is someone clogging my toilet the fuck up. Completely disgusting. Things ain't the same once you've seen a dude's stew. So tomorrow I have to get up at 9 and head up to the Omni and get all the products I need for some D.I.Y. plumbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what actually happened over the weekend. Niamh and Orla showed up and we had a good time at the time but now it's been tempered with developments. My first weekend back home sleeping in a comfy as fuck bed was pretty good too. I set up a wireless network so my bro can check his moodle from the comfort of his own desk or conservatory desk, and started using PSN, although now I have to update every game I want to play and the files are 200MB at least (I'm on Digiweb, it'd be like downloading CS5 for those of you on decent connections) and I played LittleBigPlanet, which only has 2 things going for it: Stephen Fry's narration, and the soundtrack. I have Stephen Fry narrated audiobooks and the soundtrack on my iPod, so LBP isn't being played again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went into Dundalk too, and hung out with Frank and Ri (let it be known that Ri's mom totally wants me) and although the usual suspects were absent because of exam preparation, that was probably a good thing. I went to Frank's house to pick up some PS3 games and we talked and I learned some stuff that I didn't need to know, but it's better that I do know. My room is empty apart from my clothes and some stuff for cleaning that fucking toilet now too, and I'm sorting out next year with Larney either tomorrow or on Tuesday. Still need to know who the fourth roommate is, I hope it's Fitzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully during the week I'll also be able to hang out with people I haven't seen in a bit, and go to DKIT to at long last empty my flux. Although I haven't been able to abuse it yet, it was definitely worth the 29 quid. I checked Man Without a Country by Kurt Vonnegut out of the library too, it's short comical op-eds sort of, pretty entertaining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stayed pretty on point with this one actually, took less than 10 minutes to write. But gonna continue the regular feature here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever been getting with a girl, and she starts crying because she won't be able to see you for 3 weeks?

I cleaned the fuck out of my flat and it looks pretty sweet and livable, and Niamh and Orla came over last night and drank White Russians and we had Alpha Dog on in the background, but nobody really paid attention to it. My Ubuntu install disc isn't working though, which is something I need to look into, as well as my laptop's shitty ventilation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weekend should be good though, I'll be hanging out with Frank and Ri and maybe going to the Store/Susan's Party with Darver or Niamh/Orla.

The exams themselves went alright, I completely fucked up Geography so thank God for automatic resits. I sat my last exam on a basketball court and I wish it had been one of those exams that took all 3 hours because I was sitting right next to the hoop, and me and Rory were all Man if we're here at the end, scrunch up the paper and drop a two. Shit would have been THE best way to end the fucking year. But when Summer actually started I was out at the same time as Grahame, so we went over to Spar and he got a roll and a 4 euro bottle of wine and met some of his mates and we just chilled in the Pav. I ended up ringing Carpo and I have about 150 copies of the Spanner for some reason, I mean the Spanner's awesome, but I don't have the time to be distributing it to the world, you dig? The Pav was chill though I had the best whiskey and coke ever but that was cancelled out by what was seriously the most disgusting chips I've had since Damian's in Wales when I was like 9. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was in Wales then they were doing these promotional Walkers flavours too. Shit was awesome, Cheese and Owen, Salt and Lineker, Smokey Beckham. Kind of like a Ben and Jerry's thing. They're doing another one right now actually, fan-submitted flavours like American Cheeseburger and Roast Beef and Yorkshire Pudding, which my flatmate commented "Tasted like it, but wasn't right" and then it became a kids would only know Roast Beef and Yorkshire Pud through Walkers and when given the physical real thing would say it didn't seem right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So now basically I have four and a half months of nothing but chilling and brostuff and basically I'm really hyped about it. There is good stuff up to my ears right now, and it started off awesome and so far it's been awesome. Orla and Niamh are coming up tomorrow too so it's gonna be like HAPPY 18th basically Orla buying alcohol legally for the first time in her life and making white russians, and I'll rock my Lebowski specs and talk about how I was one of the Seattle Seven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, as per Frank's suggestion, I'm introducing a CAN YOU RELATE?! feature, where I describe an experience, and you see if you can relate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have you ever met a girl, and been too nervous to get with her, so the first few times you meet up your friend has to create a situation really subtly for it to happen.

Neil Young had a song about it, and an album too with the same title although it was more about his wife, and it's never been released. The Band plays on a few of the tracks too. The Band are great, I'm not a huge fan of Music from Big Pink, but their self-titled album is one of my favourites, even if it's mostly just straight-forward songs about unions and women who help you when you're drunk and in Louisiana. They were a great backing band too, Live at the "Royal Albert Hall" is fucking hardcore, but I'm gonna get away from the whole looking for Tru Punx from a time before Punk was even used to describe a style of music, that's one thing that grinds my spark plugs man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was an absolutely terrible "punk" band in Dundalk a couple of years back, they only played a couple of gigs but they rocked Swastikas and that kind of thing without any kind of motivation other than "fuck the hippies and journalists" which sounds like something a guy ripping off Bret Easton Ellis would say to excuse a shitty novel. You don't even see hippies anymore, they've all migrated to Rastafarianism. That's not to say all non-Jamaican Rastas were hippies in a past life, I mean H.R. from Bad Brains is one and he's really just the world's biggest douchebag, although Bad Brains are a good band, and it's not enough to stop me listening to them, like I dunno Skrewdriver. The punk band had this one song, Beethoven Was a Punk, which no.&lt;br /&gt;Punk's a pretty loosely-defined term anyway, but I like the D.I.Y. aspects, and the kinda stuff Fugazi do, like having low admission prices and discouraging slam-dancing and not being self-righteous about doing those basic decent things that any band should do, except maybe the Stooges, who made antagonizing the audience part of their thing. There's a lot of good home-recorded music though, like the stuff the Guided by Voices So-Called Classic Lineup did, Bee Thousand and Vampire on Titus and what have you, and Cody ChesnuTT, Daniel Johnston, and Dylan's Basement Tapes, and so on. I guess the Library of Congress Field Recordings would count too, some of that stuff is amazing, even if the recording equipment was a bit shoddy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favourite song from the first half of the 20th century is definitely I Wish I Was a Mole in the Ground, it's pretty simple and the lyrics are really cryptic, and the effect it has is otherworldly, like a lot of the stuff from back then actually, particularly Robert Johnson, although if you slow him down it's another beast entirely. In Japan that's the prevailing opinion, that all his 78s were played at the wrong RPM, and that you need to slow it down to hear what it actually was, and if you do his voice sounds better, but his guitar is completely different and doesn't match with first-hand accounts at all, but I suppose naturally things would get exaggerated, e.g. the things said about Cool Papa Bell (Best nickname ever) and Jon Gibson and a lot of athletes from the day, but back when nobody paid attention to those kind of dudes when they were making their name it was bound to happen. Like the Four Horsemen from Notre Dame, the guy who made them famous and made an entire second income championing them and talking about how close he was to Notre Dame and Rockne in later years even though the week after he wrote the Four Horsemen article he didn't even bother to check them out when they came to New York. They weren't great players either, just really good, and completely undersized, not that that's a big thing. A team in Brooklyn signed a couple of them and tried to turn it into a marketing gimmick, but it didn't really fly because Red Grange was the big thing in 1925. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It's pretty cool to see that happen, when one guy comes in and saves a league or sport and raises it to another level, like Tiger Woods or Michael Jordan did. Red Grange did that for Pro American Football in the '20s anyway, back when it was basically considered to be as good as the Airtricity League is nowadays, and he turned it into something else and a desirable place for All-Americans to go when they graduated with their physical education degrees. I can't see any sport needing it right now, except maybe Baseball, which desperately needs someone to capture the public imagination in a good way, rather than by having paintings of themselves as centaurs and doing steroids, or just doing steroids and being an asshole. Every other major sport kind of has a lightning rod right now, except maybe Gaelic Football, I can't really think of any, although I kinda lost interest and switched to hurling after the Ulster style became popular. It was just ugly as hell to watch the Armagh team with no skills beat up Donegal who were trying to play solid graceful football, and then the back-door system giving them a second chance after they fucked up against Fermanagh or some other good team. Hurling's awesome, although I couldn't play it for love or money, but that applies to so many things it's not worth saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/04/homegrown.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/9138776346856436448'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/9138776346856436448'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-4886933852697174154</id><published>2010-04-25T23:57:00.004+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.293+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sports'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Writers'/><title type='text'>Collapsing the wavefunction</title><content type='html'>I had an article about David Wallace near-done but the draft didn't save so I'm gonna have to start from scratch here and try and get a similar kind of feel to this one. But basically a book of a 5-day road trip with David Wallace by a guy working for Rolling Stone is out, probably as a promotional thing for his unfinished thing which comes out next year. Wallace is probably my favourite writer, and his stuff was a big part of me turning from a pretentious brat into who I am now, y'know less of the look at how edgy and troubled I am to being or at least trying to be aware of things and trying to see every side of something. His death was pretty surprising for me, because it really seemed like he had it figured out, he was just completely brilliant, and he didn't rub it in your face either it was more like a conversation between friends, and it was really a pick-me-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is my last week before my college exams anyway, and by extension Saturday was my last night out before summer, although I don't really go out that much to begin with, so that I was out at all was a big deal. But it was a really good night, it reminded me why I used to go out every weekend, rather than when I wanted to get an overpriced drink and see people fall over themselves. Everything just went good. Everybody got buzzed but didn't reach a level of intoxication where they were at risk of vomiting, and it was just like a Brian Eno piece, that would be the best way of describing it. I sorted out shit man and it felt good to know where I was in things, although I'm not sure what the velocity is now, but I'm sure of the location pretty much. Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle is SO relevant to my life. It's not a big deal though, more of just a nice thing that I have going on right now, which is always cool. Overall it was pretty cool, I talked to some people I haven't seen in a while, and everybody found it necessary to say Nice beard, dude. Feltgoodman, because I'd trimmed my beard for the first time since RAG week, although I'm gonna try rock a full beard over the summer, rather than the 3/4 one I got now, I gotta the moustache and the beard connected, otherwise it's just facial hair. It's the first time I was at The Spot in a long time too (The Spot is this miniature woods off from the Spirit Store, and is ideal for sessions and shmoke and all) and talked to Shane Byrne and Jack for an ass-long time, and witnessed Ri's incredible subtlety at work. It's a fun place, one time me and a knucklehead from back in the day rang people asking for soapy titwanks, and busted a whiskey bottle with bare hands. I took the french people there back when they were around too, and managed to fall off the path.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer's a fortnight away right now, and oh boy am I excited. I gotta do the exams first, which won't be too bad (THANKS CONTINUOUS ASSESSMENT!) but once they're done I got more time to put in this blog, and cycle, and write and read and listen and chill and grow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word 'em up,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addendum to the last post: Tebow ended up going to Denver with the 25 pick, which just what the fuck, man?</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/04/collapsing-wavefunction.html#comment-form' title='2 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4886933852697174154'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4886933852697174154'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>2</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-1849440926212515325</id><published>2010-04-23T01:34:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.285+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sports'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><title type='text'>Drafts</title><content type='html'>I was planning to stay up until Tim Tebow got drafted before typing out another blog post, but fuck it. It's pick number 10, and if the Jags don't take him now then I'll write it anyway, as if he had been picked in the mid 2nd-round since basically the entire first-year DCU Actuarial Finance class is in my living room and I plan on sleeping. Anyway I been maintaining this blog as an actual regularly updated blog for about a week now and it is flowing like Slick Rick on the beat. I probably have maybe 8 readers right now in the upper regions of things, although it's probably more like four. We should get together and start a soulwave band. Call me. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But dropping names like James Lipton got 2 edges to it so people might be all "I'm not in here, you know we're pretty cool right I thought I deserved a mention?" and they did so word up to Emma, who is pretty fly for an Irish Chemistry Olympian. But it's like pick 15 now and Tebow is still on the board, which is weird since I was pretty much the Jaguars can't really pass up on him. Is this gonna turn out like a reverse-Irsay where the Jags try to move to Baltimore but then up moving to Butte or something? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn't much else going on outside of the draft like. A bunch of crockery got piled up on a sleeping actuary, but he didn't wake up while it was there so we could watch him panic and here the clank-clink of things, but some generous fellow also left a full can of Heineken for Liam, or more likely he just forgot it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's all folks,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/04/drafts.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1849440926212515325'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/1849440926212515325'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-807425028302820366</id><published>2010-04-21T01:43:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.309+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Family'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Sports'/><title type='text'>My dad, and other less important things.</title><content type='html'>I've abandoned trying to indent new paragraphs now since it turns tabbing doesn't really do anything in blogger except maybe move it into 2 spaces and I'm all ENOUGH OF &lt;b&gt;THIS&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thinking about what kind of sitcom dad I would want to be like. Like Huxtable or Niles or whoever. I'm not sure who would be the coolest, since in those sitcoms the coolest characters didn't have kids and it was like the more relatable guys like Ross who had kids. My dad isn't really like any of those sitcom dads though, my dad is more like the dude from those school dramas who turns out to be have been a really hip cat during the heyday or whatever. He went to the Who when he was 16, he told me, but nowadays he's all disappointed in modern music and doesn't really have time for it. For his 60th we went to Athlone for a day, since he was back at work on Monday so we couldn't really stay the Sunday. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was actually a completely boss hotel, it was really modern and well-designed, although the pillows were all soft and insubstantial so I watched Glory Road instead of sleeping and then regretted it heavy when I woke up. Glory Road was a pretty good film, it was bout the UTEP basketball team in the '60s and how they bet Kentucky and won the Final Four with a team of all black players which was back in the day when the SEC did not allow coloured folks in their vicinity. It kinda condensed the timeline a bit but without it the events would have not seemed quite so momentous. I was reading up about them afterwards and it turns out the press of the time was pissed as hell that Adolph Rupp had been shamed and basically accused Texas Western (as UTEP was called at time. They changed their name one year after winning a national championship, that is just bad brand management) of being a pro franchise. It was kind of like in the 1920s when Notre Dame started playing on the east coast regularly and everyone had all kinds of rumours about them, but they pulled it out when it really mattered, like when Al Smith got completely humiliated in the 1928 election by the other party pretty much making Catholics out to be worse than whoever was the Hitler proxy at the time before they had Hitler. It must have been difficult to forfeit political debates back then, you actually had to dig yourself a hole rather than just compare somebody to Hitler. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was mad vitriol against the Texas Western team, and in fairness in the '60s it was probably most strange for a small school that was not built exclusively for an occasionally-fanatical minority to get recruits from places like New York NY or Gary IN, and they were probably pissed that people were dunking and beating the old-school Kentucky team which played Solid Fundamental Basketball. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually like a year or 2 later when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar came around (Lew Alcindor, whatever, he's always gonna be Kareem) and basically showed up everyone else in the entire league as suckers they banned dunking for about ten years. They didn't even call it the slam dunk back then it seems, that term was used for a special type of dunk that Julius Erving did. I used to be really into basketball, but now it's kind of boring. I don't wanna be the guy ragging on about high salaries, but the NBA needs a salary cap badly. Like you have guys riding the bench playing sparse minutes a game getting paid more than most NFL starting quarterbacks, and the money's guaranteed too, so they can do whatever they want and they still get paid. It's insane, and all it leads to is dudes like Vince Carter, who I used to admire but now think is a massive jerk-off. There were backups in the NBA in 2008 who were making more than RYAN HOWARD! Think about that. There's gonna be a strike next year or something so maybe David Stern will finally introduce a salary cap and bring some sense back and leave the insane guaranteed money for Chris Bosh and the like. Y'know, dudes who actually earn it.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my dad's probably retiring within the next 14 months. He's earned it, he's worked 39 years basically as what is the most-reviled profession in Ireland for some reason (teacher, but not like loan shark or heroin pusher or any number of worse things that people do not get upset about) and I know because my mom had me go over the figures for what his pension would be based on retiring in July vs. retiring at the end of next year. There's not much point in him working beyond 40 years from the financial side of things, but also I think both him and my mom want him retiring a bit before he's 65 because basically the correlation between Length of Enjoyed Retirement and Proximity to 65 at Time of Retirement for teachers is kind of a scary sight, like on average a teacher that retires at 65 will live for 2 years of pension-collecting and hobby-pursuing, tops.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That blog post was meant to be a short, kind of sentimental thing about my dad but it ended up being a lot longer, and I'm pursuing a policy of Raw and Unfiltered, and I'm not gonna tag it either, since that would involve having a spreadsheet to keep track of my tags to stop one-off tags or tags with subtle variations that defeat the purpose of tags and Excel is not my game, and plus the National's new album is now online and I must give it a listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slán,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/04/my-dad-and-other-less-important-things.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/807425028302820366'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/807425028302820366'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7911163067833317365</id><published>2010-04-19T15:32:00.002+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.307+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Catching up'/><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Social life'/><title type='text'>The 4th one usually sucks.

My exams start in 2 weeks, and they should go alright, with the exception of Chemistry 2 I'm pretty well prepared for them. I met a few cool people this year too, generally the science course is filled with sound dudes. The same applies to Shanowen. Ian moved out in February to a new place, but Liam and Cian are still here and they are 2 solid people. Cian's girlfriend is around sometimes too, and as a 3rd year Trinity science student, she has been giving the helpful advice about it. Dan's also here pretty much every day, and his love of life is infectious. He'll be making me and my brother a sandwich before he dies, it's on his bucket list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Dundalk things are improving too. I have a few good friends who are generally there for me and being cool. Shouts out to Fitzy and Frank. Frank is a really good listener, even though recently I have mostly been rambling about my own insecurities. He has the leaving cert coming up, and I am occupying his time. But if you're reading this Frank, thanks bro. Niamh and a few other people are also really cool too, even though I totally flaked on Niamh and invited to her to what is contender for World's Worst Party 2010. She brought Sarah with her, who I have not seen in over a year, and I got my brother's CD back. It's good to see people after a long furlough, even if circumstances of parting weren't exactly good. Thinking about how close we used to be, it's actually slightly surreal, and a few things that happened are nestled in the back of my mind and are basically steroids for the neurotic parts of me that are so raw that the IOC does not even know about them, and it's the last thing I need right now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also got talking to Noonan, and him and the Whales are getting back together and recording over the summer. It's going to be one of the best records I hear this year, they're one of the few bands on the Dundalk scene right now that I'm feeling. Noonan's a fantastic guitarist too, and he writes some funny lyrics. That'd probably change if he listened to Brand New's later stuff, but right now he's all about the fun pop-punk about girls and skateboards. It suits him, he's great with melodies, although he doesn't take me seriously when I compliment his abilities. But I'm definitely picking up the vinyl when it drops, harsh tunes and hopefully a kick-ass live show for accompaniment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have a crush on someone; the last time I did I think people were still wondering if Eminem was going to release a comeback album. I don't know if she feels similarly, although she seems to. I'm a novice at this kind of stuff. Previous relationships and all that make me a wreck with this kind of stuff, even though it really has no bearing on it. I don't know if I have any reason to be nervous, I'm just worried I'll lose her interest by being dull or coming on too strong or too weak or something. She's actually pretty cool and all too, she's got amazing taste in music and I could talk to her for ages. I dunno if anything more's going to happen though, but it would be cool as hell if it did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My MSN got hacked too it seems, and that's probably related to her, given that she's the only person who got sent messages from it. I think I know who did it, but I can't really act upon it because a) I'm not 100% sure and b) It would have bad consequences all around really. I've changed my password and I'm probably going to get a new MSN, so it shouldn't happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went into Dundalk on Friday and Saturday for what was probably the first time in ages, since everyone seemed shocked by my new facial hair. It was pretty good seeing everyone again, and I hung out with the girl from the previous paragraph for a bit on Saturday, which was good craic, and then went out to a double-18th in Ravensdale. I wasn't expecting much, but it turned out to be good buzz. Steve brought a frisbee and I discussed situations with Frank. He's planning to leave the Bush by changing all their keyboards to Dvorak, which will be hilarious. I'd forgotten how much I liked everyone in that group. They're, for the most part, really chill people. Leno and Devenney were there too. Me and Devenney used to straight up hate each other, but now he's a legend, and nobody got really pissed, so it wasn't like I felt out of place for being pretty much the only sober person around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That's pretty much it in terms of new events. 4/20 tomorrow so I'm hitting up DKIT with Mully, and we're going to get nicely toasted. I was hoping to have the pokeball bong by that point, but it's not happening. Still something to look forward to in the summer though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summer '10 is going to be the shit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace out,&lt;br /&gt;Cathal</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/04/4th-one-usually-sucks-im-bucking-trend.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7911163067833317365'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/7911163067833317365'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7764346172577297391</id><published>2010-04-13T00:50:00.001+01:00</published><updated>2011-10-05T19:02:10.305+01:00</updated><app:control xmlns:app='http://purl.org/atom/app#'><app:draft>yes</app:draft></app:control><category scheme='http://www.blogger.com/atom/ns#' term='Lists'/><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#post'/><title type='text'>Gran Blog 3 Prologue: Concept</title><content type='html'>I love 4chan.

I went to 2 shindigs in Christine's house and I had a pretty good time, and I went to the cinema by myself. But other bad shit has happened too. Everyone's going down with some gland infection and it's a bit weird as I was told it wasn't contagious. And one of my best mates got fucked over too, and I'm kinda pissed at the people who did it. But tomorrow I'm going to Kevin's house and me and Mark are gonna make some fuckin' memories then go out to the pub and make some more with everyone else. It's gonna be a great weekend.</content><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2009/09/new-post-cos-i-havent-used-this-in-6.html#comment-form' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4627841837835623626'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/posts/default/4627841837835623626'/><author><name>Mane</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/00806271956586999215</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//1.bp.blogspot.com/-dQmeJgm7MEA/T-jSR9XLanI/AAAAAAAAAOo/HGbgGgjZ7GM/s32/dogg_we_have_manes.jpg'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-7484829640651968715</id><published>2010-04-27T00:26:36.258+01:00</published><updated>2010-04-27T00:26:36.258+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>I do apologise for the beard-pulling...</title><content type='html'>I do apologise for the beard-pulling...</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/4886933852697174154/comments/default/7484829640651968715'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/4886933852697174154/comments/default/7484829640651968715'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/04/collapsing-wavefunction.html?showComment=1272324396258#c7484829640651968715' title=''/><author><name>Orla</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/17543328148374501813</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='24' src='//4.bp.blogspot.com/_uv4sNAPA2XI/S82lgJmciqI/AAAAAAAAAK4/FcZOAyYEXnM/S220-s32/PARTAYZ+033.jpg'/></author><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1242601707'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='27 April 2010 at 00:26'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-4586264635553645726</id><published>2010-04-28T00:03:15.780+01:00</published><updated>2010-04-28T00:03:15.780+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>I wouldn&amp;#39;t call Piper a knucklehead exactly......</title><content type='html'>I wouldn&amp;#39;t call Piper a knucklehead exactly... he&amp;#39;s just a little different</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/4886933852697174154/comments/default/4586264635553645726'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='https://www.blogger.com/feeds/3181520561541210833/4886933852697174154/comments/default/4586264635553645726'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://myacehen.blogspot.com/2010/04/collapsing-wavefunction.html?showComment=1272409395780#c4586264635553645726' title=''/><author><name>conall</name><uri>https://www.blogger.com/profile/07840969148105604456</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='35' height='35' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/zFdxGE77vvD2w5xHy6jkVuElKv-U9_9qLkRYK8OnbDeJPtjSZ82UPq5w6hJ-SA=s35'/></author><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-758196769'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='28 April 2010 at 00:03'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-3181520561541210833.post-365209314248362051</id><published>2010-05-14T00:09:54.469+01:00</published><updated>2010-05-14T00:09:54.469+01:00</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>You know.
